_An interlude in the middle of a series for a special post, in a somewhat more festive spirit, for Yom Ha'atzmaut (Israeli Independence Day)._

_See my recent two-part series on this; this piece is a continuation: “ChavrutAI Web App in Progress: Advancing the Vision of a More Accessible Talmud”, final part [here](https://www.ezrabrand.com/p/pt2-chavrutai-web-app-in-progress)._

The digitization of classical texts presents interesting challenges that extend beyond mere preservation. How do we transform millennia-old documents into interactive, searchable, and accessible resources while honoring their original structure and content? This question guided our development of ChavrutAI, a digital platform for studying Jewish texts with particular emphasis on the Babylonian Talmud (Talmud Bavli).

This article examines the key interface design decisions we made in creating the mock-ups for the planned ChavrutAI UX/UI/ interface, focusing on how traditional methods of Jewish text study informed our approach to creating an intuitive digital learning environment.

_Link to the mock-up:_

## Honoring Tradition Through Design

The Talmud has a well-established physical format that has remained relatively consistent since the Bomberg edition was printed in Venice in the 16th century. Before making any design decisions, we asked ourselves: which elements of the traditional page layout are essential to the learning experience, and which could be reimagined for a digital context?

### The Visual Foundation: Color and Typography

Our first design choice was the background color—a light sepia tone that evokes the warmth of parchment and many traditional printed volumes. This subtle coloration reduces eye strain during extended study sessions while creating an atmosphere of scholarly gravitas. Unlike stark white backgrounds common in many digital reading platforms, the sepia tone is significantly easier on the eyes.[1](https://www.ezrabrand.com/p/designing-chavrutai-building-a-customized#footnote-1-162597452)

For typography, we placed Hebrew text in bold, as that generally works well. The right-to-left Hebrew text appears on the right side of the screen, with corresponding English translations on the left—reflecting the natural reading pattern of bilingual learners while allowing easy comparison between the original text and its translation.

## Navigation Architecture

Perhaps the most significant interface challenge was creating a navigation system that accommodates the organization of the Talmud.

Traditional Talmud study involves reference to specific tractates, chapters, and folios (pages), often requiring scholars to move between sections to follow an argument or cross-reference related discussions.

### Breadcrumb Navigation with Hierarchical Dropdowns

We implemented a breadcrumb-style navigation bar displaying the reader's current location within the text: Tractate > Section > Chapter > Page.

Each element is interactive, featuring dropdown menus that allow quick movement between different sections of text.

#### Work dropdown: Bible, Mishnah, Talmud Yerushalmi, and Talmud Bavli

The work dropdown arranges Jewish texts in chronological order—Bible, Mishnah, Talmud Yerushalmi, and Talmud Bavli—reflecting the chronology of these works.

This ordering serves both navigational and pedagogical purposes, subtly reinforcing the relationship between these texts.

_Screenshot of work dropdown:_

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C6QI!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0433011e-cddc-4fcd-b16b-c6dcb85efe6f_952x745.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C6QI!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0433011e-cddc-4fcd-b16b-c6dcb85efe6f_952x745.png)

#### Tracate / Book dropdown

The tracate dropdown presents all tractates within the selected text collection, sorted in the traditional order.

For the Mishnah and Talmud, this is the relevant tractates from Berachot through Niddah. (For Bible, it’s the 24 books of the Hebrew Bible / Tanakh, from Genesis to Chronicles.)

_Screenshot of tractate dropdown opened:_

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Yycc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c8c3e6-d0f7-4664-8448-0999e2df1f1a_946x745.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Yycc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9c8c3e6-d0f7-4664-8448-0999e2df1f1a_946x745.png)

#### Chapter dropdown

_Screenshot of chapter dropdown:_

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QP3f!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd90442ea-20c2-40c6-8275-34164e481aa5_952x751.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QP3f!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd90442ea-20c2-40c6-8275-34164e481aa5_952x751.png)

Perhaps most innovative is our chapter dropdown, which not only lists chapters numerically (Chapter 1, Chapter 2, etc.) but also includes the folio range for each chapter in parentheses.[2](https://www.ezrabrand.com/p/designing-chavrutai-building-a-customized#footnote-2-162597452)

The ranges follow the traditional overlapping pattern of Talmudic pagination—Chapter 1 (2-10), Chapter 2 (10-20), and so on.[3](https://www.ezrabrand.com/p/designing-chavrutai-building-a-customized#footnote-3-162597452)

This gives scholars immediate context about the extent of each chapter and allows those familiar with specific folio references to quickly locate content.

#### Page dropdown (Folio / Daf ; Page / Amud ; Verse ; Mishnah Section)

_Screenshot of page dropdown:_

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1NVU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86af2a9b-4678-4db9-a17c-b234cfd11fe8_951x742.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1NVU!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F86af2a9b-4678-4db9-a17c-b234cfd11fe8_951x742.png)

The page dropdown reflects the distinct pagination system of the Talmud, with each physical folio (= _daf; “blatt”_ in Yiddish) divided into "a" (front) and "b" (back) sides (=page / _amud_).[4](https://www.ezrabrand.com/p/designing-chavrutai-building-a-customized#footnote-4-162597452)

Our interface provides easy navigation between these divisions.[5](https://www.ezrabrand.com/p/designing-chavrutai-building-a-customized#footnote-5-162597452)

One can also navigate to the next or previous page via button at the bottom of the page, screenshot (arrows added to the screenshot to highlight the relevant visual elements):

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bDFQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f204627-3e61-45cf-a799-b6a980354f18_924x739.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!bDFQ!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8f204627-3e61-45cf-a799-b6a980354f18_924x739.png)

## Content Presentation

### Side-by-Side Bilingual Display

The heart of ChavrutAI's interface is the side-by-side presentation of Hebrew and English text. We present both languages simultaneously, with each logical segment/verse paired with its translation.

This layout accommodates different reading strategies:

1. For native Hebrew readers who occasionally need translation assistance

2. For English readers learning Hebrew who want to compare texts

3. For bilingual readers who may prefer reading one language but reference the other


## Attribution and Scholarly Context

_Screenshot of footer:_

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArAA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F085b73f3-e16a-474f-8a92-29bfc05c5d76_925x72.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ArAA!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F085b73f3-e16a-474f-8a92-29bfc05c5d76_925x72.png)

The footer contains important contextual information: "ChavrutAI - Making the Talmud more accessible for contemporary study \| Data provided by Sefaria (not affiliated) \| Open-source project."

This transparency serves several purposes:

1. It acknowledges the source of our textual data (Sefaria, a digital library of Jewish texts)

2. It clarifies our independent status to prevent confusion

3. It emphasizes our commitment to open-source principles and collaborative scholarship


This attribution is especially important in the context of Jewish textual study, where proper citation and intellectual honesty have always been core values.

## Mobile Accessibility

_Screenshot of mobile view:_

[![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C2_v!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8ae419c-eb38-4148-8603-c533f73d84f1_274x552.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!C2_v!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8ae419c-eb38-4148-8603-c533f73d84f1_274x552.png)

While traditional Talmud study often involves large volumes spread across a table, modern scholars increasingly need access to texts in varied contexts.

Our responsive design includes a carefully considered mobile experience with a slide-out menu that preserves all navigation options while optimizing the reading experience for smaller screens.

## Future Directions

The current interface represents our initial approach to digital Talmud study, but several enhancements are already planned:

1. **Integrated Commentary Display:** Adding the ability to view enhancements like Jastrow’s Dictionary (modernized) alongside the main text

2. **Thematic Navigation:** Creating alternative navigation paths based on concepts and themes rather than just traditional pagination[6](https://www.ezrabrand.com/p/designing-chavrutai-building-a-customized#footnote-6-162597452)

3. **Advanced Search Capabilities:** Implementing sophisticated search tools that understand the complex relationships between Talmudic passages

4. An AI / LLM-powered “chavruta”


## Conclusion

Digital interfaces for ancient texts must balance innovation with respect for tradition. With ChavrutAI, we've attempted to create an environment that feels welcoming to those experienced in traditional Talmud study while making the text more accessible to all.

The challenges of digital text presentation—navigation, context, bilingual display, and attribution—each presented opportunities to reflect on how scholars have interacted with these texts for centuries. By approaching interface design as a form of textual interpretation itself, we hope ChavrutAI contributes meaningfully to the evolving landscape of Jewish text study.

Our design philosophy throughout has been guided by the principle that technology should enhance the depth of engagement that characterizes traditional learning. In the spirit of chavruta (partnership study)—the traditional method of learning Talmud with a study partner—we view this interface as a partner in the learning process: supportive, clear, and designed to elevate rather than simplify the rich complexity of the text.

We welcome feedback from scholars and students as we continue to refine this tool for contemporary Talmud study.

Not directly related to the above, I just published at my Academia page: “Mapping table of Jastrow abbreviations”, with 400+ mappings.

As part of my ongoing work on a Jastrow Dictionary Abbreviation Modernizer.

Compare Jastrow's own mapping, at Sefaria:

We plan to play around with the color more, for a more subtle range of light sepia / light grays.

Using sepia as the background was partially inspired by these models:
