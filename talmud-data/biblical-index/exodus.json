A cup of blessing over which to recite a blessing and he does not recite a blessing, as it is written: “I will bless them that bless you” (Genesis 12:3); one who blesses is blessed and one who does not bless does not merit a blessing. And with regard to one who conducts himself with an air of superiority, as R' Ḥama ben Ḥanina, said: Why did Joseph die before his brothers,  as evidenced by the order in the verse: “And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation” (Exodus 1:6)? Because he conducted himself with an air of superiority,  and those who did not serve in a leadership role lived on after he died."

R' Yosei ben Ḥanina, says:  The use of the phrase “every son that is born” indicates that he decreed even on his own nation that all their male babies must be killed. And R' Yosei ben Ḥanina, says further: He decreed three decrees. Initially,  he commanded the midwives only with regard to Jewish infants: “You shall look upon the stones. If it be a son, then you shall kill him;  but if it be a daughter, then she shall live” (Exodus 1:16). And afterward,  he decreed with regard to the Jewish infants: “Every son that is born you shall cast into the river” (Exodus 1:22). And ultimately, he decreed even on his own nation that Egyptian infant boys should be cast into the river as well."

Once Jochebed cast Moses into the water, although he was protected in an ark, the astrologers said: We no longer see in the stars anything like that sign we saw as to the downfall of the leader of the Jews by water, and therefore at that moment they canceled their decree. But they did not know that what they saw foretold that Moses would be stricken on account of the waters of Meribah.  They envisioned a downfall for Moses by water but didn’t fully comprehend their vision."

This was explained as R' Ḥama ben Ḥanina, says:  The “daughter of Levi” is Jochebed, whose conception was on the road,  as the family of Jacob descended to Egypt, and she was born between the walls,  i.e., in Egypt, as it is stated:  “And the name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt” (Numbers 26:59)."

And where does it say that Moses vowed to Yitro? For it is written: “And Moses was content [vayo’el] to dwell with the man” (Exodus 2:21).

Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says: It stands to reason in accordance with the one who says that they transmit it once every seven years, as it is written: “This is My name forever [le’olam]” (Exodus 3:15), which is written so that it can be read le’alem,  to hide. This indicates that the Divine Name must remain hidden. The Talmud relates: Rava planned to expound and explain the proper way to say the name in a public discourse. A certain elder said to him: It is written so that it can be read le’alem,  indicating that it must stay hidden."

Since a camel’s back is high off the ground, a woman cannot sit on it sidesaddle; consequently, she may ride on it without being considered immodest. The Talmud cites another relevant verse. But isn’t it written: “And Moses took his wife and his children and rode them upon his donkey” (Exodus 4:20)? The Talmud answers: There,  despite the fact that his wife was also on the donkey, the verse employs the language of riding"

With regard to the term hamotzi, as the Rabbis hold that hamotzi means that God brought forth,  in the past tense, as it is written: “Who brought forth [hamotzi] for you water from a rock of flint” (Deuteronomy 8:15), which depicts a past event. R' Neḥemya holds that the term hamotzi means that God brings forth in the present tense, as it is stated in Moses’ prophecy to the Jewish people in Egypt: “And you will know that I am YHWH your God who is bringing you forth [hamotzi] from under the burdens of Egypt” (Exodus 6:7). Since, in that context, hamotzi is used with regard to an event transpiring in the present or possibly even one that will transpire in the future, it is inappropriate to include this term in a blessing referencing the past."

This teaches that this month is Nisan, and another month cannot be Nisan.  Therefore, the court cannot add another month of Nisan. The Talmud answers: Hezekiah erred with regard to the halakha that would later be expounded by Shmuel. As Shmuel says:  The court may not intercalate the year on the thirtieth day of Adar, since although it is part of Adar, it is fit to establish it as the first day of Nisan.  As the day that may be assigned as the New Moon of Nisan, it has the same status as does Nisan, and the year may not be intercalated then."

As it is taught in a baraita: The verse states, with regard to the Paschal offering: “And if the household be too little for a lamb,  then he and his neighbor next to his house shall take one” (Exodus 12:4). The phrase “if the household be too little” is interpreted to mean that the household cannot afford the basic necessities of the Festival."

This proves that a slaughtered animal is not considered a lamb.

The Talmud asks: And if that was not so,  there would not be permission to do so? Didn’t the Master say:  The meat of a kid, whether it is in an oven that is sealed or whether it is in one that is not sealed,  everyone agrees that he may well place it in the oven at nightfall because taking it out of the oven harms it, and there is no room for concern that he will do so? If so, there is no room for concern with regard to the meat of the Paschal lamb, which must be either a goat or a lamb (Exodus 12:5). The Talmud answers: In any case, it is necessary to emphasize the vigilance of the members of the group, as there,  where it was permitted, it was specifically in a case that the goat was cut into pieces. However, here,  with regard to the Paschal lamb, the goat is not cut into pieces. It is roasted whole, in accordance with the halakhot of the Paschal lamb. Consequently, it does not roast quickly, and there is room for concern lest he stoke the coals in order to accelerate the roasting.

Leftover meat of the Paschal lamb is not burned on the following morning, which is a Festival, but rather on the following day, the first of the intermediate days of the Festival. Even though the labor of kindling a fire is not entirely prohibited on a Festival, as one may cook and bake, it is derived from here that kindling a fire is permitted only for the purpose of preparing food for the immediate needs of the day and not for purposes that can be postponed until the intermediate days. Similarly, since circumcision involves a prohibited labor, it is permitted on the 8th day only when there is no option of postponing it. Otherwise, doing so is prohibited."

How can this apparent contradiction be resolved? The Talmud responds: The latter verse comes to include the fourteenth day of Nisan with regard to the elimination of leaven.

The verse referring to peace offerings states: “If he offers a lamb for his offering” (Leviticus 3:7). The Torah could simply have stated: A lamb,  and proceed from there to teach the halakhot of a lamb peace offering. If so, what is the meaning when the verse states: “If he offers a lamb”?  This serves to include the substitute of a Paschal offering that was substituted after the sacrifice of the Paschal offering,  teaching that it is sacrificed as a peace offering,  since the Paschal offering has the status of a peace offering after that time. One might have thought that even before the sacrifice of the Paschal offering the same should apply, i.e., that the substitute of a Paschal offering is sacrificed as a peace offering. Therefore, the verse states with regard to the Paschal offering: “It is the sacrifice of YHWH’s Passover” (Exodus 12:27), which indicates that it,  the Paschal offering itself, is sacrificed, but its substitute is not sacrificed."

The Talmud answers that the verse states: “And you shall perform, ” which teaches that the halakhot of the Paschal lamb in later generations are the same as the halakhot that applied in Egypt. The Talmud asks: But if so, why do I need the qualifying term “from it”?  The Talmud answers that it teaches that from it,  the Paschal lamb, apostasy disqualifies one from partaking, but apostasy does not disqualify one from eating teruma. "

The Talmud spells out these stringencies: An uncircumcised man lacks the act of circumcision, and this act is performed on his body;  the failure to perform circumcision is punishable by karet;  circumcision existed before the divine word was spoken at Mount Sinai, as the mitzva of circumcision had already been given to Abraham; and the lack of circumcision of one’s male children and slaves precludes one’s eating the Paschal lamb, as is explicitly stated in the Torah (Exodus 12:48)."

One verse says: “Matzot shall be eaten for seven days, and no leavened bread shall be seen with you, neither shall there be leaven seen with you,  in all your borders” (Exodus 13:7), and another verse states: “Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses” (Exodus 12:19), while a 3rd verse says: “Seven days shall you eat matzot, yet on the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses” (Exodus 12:15)."

The reason is that this can be derived by a verbal analogy between the term passing,  in the verse: “And you shall cause to pass to YHWH all that open the womb” (Exodus 13:12), and the same term passing, from a verse concerning animal tithe:  “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, any one that passes under the rod, the 10th shall be sacred unto YHWH” (Leviticus 27:32). This verbal analogy teaches that if the firstborn of a ewe or a she-goat is an animal of diverse kinds it is not considered a firstborn with regard to the halakhot of firstborn animals, which means that Rava’s principle is not necessary here."

Second, both are sanctified by human action rather than intrinsically consecrated.  Additionally, they are not included among the gifts to the priest. Finally, both begin life as regular animals rather than as animals with the unique status of being born first.

This proves that a slaughtered animal is not considered a lamb. The Talmud rejects this claim: It is different there, as that tanna derives a verbal analogy of “lamb” (Exodus 13:13) and “lamb” (Exodus 12:4) from the Paschal offering:  Just as a slaughtered lamb cannot be used for a Paschal offering, the same applies to the case of a firstborn donkey."

The baraita explains: What is the meaning of “with him”?  The phrase “with him” indicates that Joseph’s bones were taken within Moses’s boundary, with him in the Levite camp.  This demonstrates that even a corpse may be brought into the Levite camp. If so, certainly a nazirite who was impure from contact with a corpse and who has been sprinkled and immersed may enter there. Consequently, the halakha that a nazirite must wait until the 8th day to sacrifice his offerings cannot be due to a prohibition against entering the Gate of Nicanor.

And ultimately it is written: “And let them make Me a Sanctuary, that I may dwell among them” (Exodus 25:8), i.e., even while they were still in the desert, which indicates that due to their closeness to God, they enjoyed greater affection and He therefore advanced what would originally have come later."

Apparently, the first six days after this command were weekdays on which the manna fell, and the fifteenth of Iyyar was Shabbat. And from the fact that the fifteenth of Iyyar was Shabbat,  the New Moon of Sivan was on the first day of the week.  This is difficult according to the opinion of the Rabbis.

The Talmud derives that one is rescued from the pangs of Messiah by means of a verbal analogy. It is written here,  with regard to Shabbat, day:  “Eat it today” (Exodus 16:25). And it is written there,  with regard to Messiah, day: “Behold, I am sending you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and awesome day of God” (Malachi 3:23). The Talmud derives that one is rescued from the judgment of Gehenna by means of a verbal analogy. It is written here,  with regard to Shabbat, day,  as cited above. And it is written there,  day: “That day will be a day of wrath,  a day of trouble and distress, a day of destruction and desolation, a day of darkness and blackness, a day of cloud and thick fog” (Zephaniah 1:15), which is interpreted as referring to the punishment of Gehenna. The Talmud derives that one is rescued from the war of Gog and Magog by means of a verbal analogy. It is written here,  with regard to Shabbat, day. And it is written there,  with regard to the War of Gog and Magog, day: “And it shall be on that day, on the day that Gog arrives on the land of Israel” (Ezekiel 38:18)."

And that day was Shabbat, as it is written: “And in the morning, then you shall see the glory of YHWH;  for He has heard your murmurings against YHWH; and what are we, that you murmur against us? ” (Exodus 16:7). The next day the glory of God was revealed, and He told them that in the afternoon the manna and quail would begin to fall, and it is written: “Six days you shall gather it;  but on the 7th day is Sabbath, there shall be none in it” (Exodus 16:26). Apparently, the first six days after this command were weekdays on which the manna fell, and the fifteenth of Iyyar was Shabbat. And from the fact that the fifteenth of Iyyar was Shabbat,  the New Moon of Sivan was on the first day of the week.  This is difficult according to the opinion of the Rabbis.  The Talmud answers: According to the Rabbis, a day was added to Iyyar that year and it was thirty days long. Therefore, the New Moon of Sivan was on Monday."

Does it enter your mind that Moses would sit and judge all day long?  If so, when was his Torah study accomplished? Rather,  surely the verse is coming to tell you: Any judge who judges a true judgment truthfully, even if he sits in judgment only one hour, the verse ascribes to him as if he became a partner to God in the act of Creation,  as by means of a true judgment he upholds the world (Me’iri). This conclusion is derived by means of a verbal analogy [gezera shava]: It is written here: “And the people stood over Moses from the morning until the evening. ” And it is written there,  in the act of Creation: “And it was evening and it was morning, one day” (Genesis 1:5).

From where is it derived that a woman who discharges semen even on the 3rd day after sex is ritually impure,  just like one who touches semen (see Leviticus 15:17)? Because the semen remains fit for insemination, it can transmit impurity, as it is stated prior to the revelation at Sinai: “And he said to the people, prepare yourselves for three days,  do not approach a woman” (Exodus 19:15). This three-day separation period ensured that even a woman who discharged semen would be pure. The Mishnah cites another halakha based on a biblical allusion: From where is it derived that one may wash the circumcision on the 3rd day,  meaning the 3rd day after the circumcision, even if it occurs on Shabbat? As it is stated: “And it came to pass on the 3rd day when they were in pain” (Genesis 34:25). The pain of circumcision lasts at least three days, and as long as the child is in pain he is considered to be in danger. The Mishnah cites another halakha with an allusion in the Bible: From where is it derived that one ties a scarlet strip of wool to the head of the scapegoat that is dispatched to Azazel? As it is stated: “If your sins be like scarlet, they will become white like snow” (Isaiah 1:18). Since the goat is offered to atone for sins, red wool is tied to its horns. The Mishnah cites another allusion. From where is it derived that smearing oil on one’s body is like drinking and is similarly prohibited on Yom Kippur? Although there is no proof for this, there is an allusion to it, as it is stated: “And it comes into his inward parts like water and like oil into his bones” (Psalms 109:18). The verse appears to equate smearing oil on one’s body with drinking water."

The phrase, in a voice, adds nothing. Rather, to what purpose did the verse state: In a voice? In Moses’ voice,  i.e., in a voice no louder than Moses’ voice. This verse instructs subsequent generations that Torah readers and translators should keep their voices at an equal volume just as Moses transmitted God’s word to the people and their voices were equal in volume."

One might have thought that it is permitted to bow even to a person who is worshipped like a god, like Haman;  therefore, the verse states: “Nor worship them, ” i.e., any form of pagan worship is prohibited. Abaye concludes: And wasn’t Haman worshipped due to fear,  and not because the people considered him a god? Evidently, one who engages in idol worship due to fear is liable."

Where R' Yosei and the rabbis disagree is with regard to the determination of the month,  meaning which day of the week was established as the New Moon. R' Yosei held:  The New Moon was established on the first day of the week, and on the first day of the week He did not say anything to them due to the weariness caused by the journey. On the second day of the week, He said to them: “And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation; these are the words that you shall speak to the children of Israel” (Exodus 19:6)."

The Talmud asks: And where is this statement of R' Ile’a stated?  The Talmud answers that it is stated concerning this Mishnah (Makkot 4a). If witnesses said: We testify that so-and-so owes another two hundred dinar, and these witnesses were discovered to be conspiring witnesses; they are flogged and pay, as the source [shem] that brings them to liability to receive lashes does not bring them to liability for payment.  Each liability has an independent source; the source for lashes is: “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor,” (Exodus 20:13) while the source for payment is: “You shall do unto him as he conspired” (Deuteronomy 19:19). This is the statement of R' Meir. And the Rabbis say: Anyone who pays is not flogged. "

This last verse mentions both place and fleeing, and the term place is derived from the term fleeing. And the term fleeing is derived from the term fleeing,  written in a different verse with regard to the unwitting murderer: “But if the slayer shall at any time come outside the border of the city of his refuge, whither he has fled” (Numbers 35:26). And the term fleeing is derived from the term border,  which appears in the same verse. And the term border is derived from the term border,  as it states there: “And the avenger of blood find him outside [miḥutz] the borders of the city of his refuge” (Numbers 35:27). Since this verse mentions both the term border and the term outside, the term border is derived from the term outside. And the term outside is derived from the term outside, as it is written with regard to the Levite cities, which also served as cities of refuge: “And you shall measure from outside [miḥutz] the city on the east side two thousand cubits,  and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits” (Numbers 35:5).

The use of the term yazid in this context and its juxtaposition to the word “man” teaches that a man can heat [mezid] himself up and produce viable sperm, but a minor cannot heat himself up and produce viable sperm.  Therefore, even though a minor can engage in full sex with a woman, he cannot father a child. Rav Mordekhai said to Rav Ashi: From where may it be inferred that this word mezid is a term meaning heating up? As it is written in a different verse: “And Jacob cooked [vayyazed] pottage” (Genesis 25:29)."

The Talmud answers that it is because the verse states: “The ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death” (Exodus 21:29); the juxtaposition of the ox and its owner indicates that as the death of the owner,  i.e., a person, for killing another person, so is the death of the ox for killing a person. In other words, the two halakhot are applied in the same circumstances. Specifically, just as the owner,  i.e., a person, is not liable to receive court-imposed capital punishment unless he intends to kill the person whom he ultimately kills, so too, an ox is not put to death either, unless it intends to kill the one whom it ultimately kills."

If the ox killed a freeman,  its owner gives his price as payment to his heirs. This sum can be more or less than thirty shekels.

That other opinion apparently holds that the owner of the injured animal is responsible for retrieving the carcass."

The thief’s sale of the animal is invalid before the owner’s despair, and therefore the sale is easily undone. Rather,  it must be referring to a sale that took place after the owner’s despair. And one can conclude from the baraita that there is liability to pay the fourfold or fivefold payment only if the animal is sold after the owner’s despair.

The Talmud answers: This is not done, because misuse of consecrated property and the slaughter or sale of a stolen cow or sheep are two verses that come as one, and any two verses that come as one do not teach their common aspect to apply to other cases. The Talmud clarifies: The verse pertaining to misuse of consecrated property is that which we said,  but what is the verse with regard to slaughter or sale? The verse states: “And he slaughters it or sells it” (Exodus 21:37), juxtaposing selling to slaughtering: Just as a sale is necessarily performed by means of another,  since every transaction involves two parties, so too slaughter can likewise be performed by means of another,  and the thief is liable even if the act of slaughtering is performed by his agent."

Why not? Granted that he does not pay to the first thief, as the verse states: “And it was stolen from the house of the man;  if the thief shall be found he shall pay double” (Exodus 22:6), which indicates that the double payment applies in the case of an item “stolen from the house of the man,” i.e., from the owner’s jurisdiction, but not to an item stolen from the thief’s house. But let him pay the double payment to the owner,  as it presumably still belonged to the owner when the second thief stole it."

The rabbis derived from these verses that the bailee is liable if the item was given to him to safeguard, but not where it was given to him to destroy;  if it was given to him to safeguard, but not where it was given to him to tear;  if it was given to him to safeguard, but not where it was given to him to distribute to the poor.  This indicates that a bailee is not liable for damage to an item if he was told to tear it, even if the owner did not state that it is on condition to be exempt."

This teaches that she requires betrothal from him. And if the verse is speaking of one who seduced her for the sake of marriage, why do I need betrothal?  The act of sex can serve as the betrothal. Rather, the baraita must be referring to a case where he seduced her not for the sake of marriage. Abaye said to him:  Even if he seduced her for the sake of marriage, she requires an additional betrothal with her father’s consent,  since she is a minor and became betrothed without it."

The verse was expounded earlier (4b) as teaching that one must separate first fruits before separating teruma.

Accordingly, if any part of the fetus leaves the womb before the slaughter, it is rendered permanently prohibited."

The Torah states: “Three Festivals [regalim] you shall celebrate for Me in the year” (Exodus 23:14).

According to the way in which the verse is written, without vocalization, it can be read as yireh,  meaning: Shall see,  instead of yera’eh,  meaning: Shall appear.  This teaches that in the same manner that one comes to see, so he comes to appear,  i.e., to be seen: Just as the usual way to see is with both of one’s eyes, so too,  the obligation to appear applies only to one who comes with the sight of both his eyes.

If one slaughters an animal for the sake of the Paschal offering on the fourteenth of Nisan after noon while he has leaven in his possession, he is flogged for violating the prohibition: “You shall not slaughter the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread” (Exodus 23:18). If he slaughtered the animal not for the sake of the Paschal offering, he is exempt from receiving lashes. And if he slaughtered the animal during the festival of Passover for the sake of the Paschal offering with leaven in his possession, he is exempt,  because it is a disqualified Paschal offering, as it was slaughtered beyond its appointed time. But if he slaughtered the animal during the Festival not for the sake of the Paschal offering, but rather as a peace offering, he is liable for slaughtering the animal with leaven in his possession."

However, in another verse it is written: “And he shall burn upon it the fat of the peace-offerings” (Leviticus 6:5), and it is interpreted: Upon it you shall complete all the offerings,  which indicates that the fats of all the offerings brought during the day must be burned before the daily afternoon offering."

The Talmud asks: What is the reason for R' Shimon’s opinion? The Talmud answers: As it is written: “My sacrifice [zivḥi], ” “My sacrifice [zivḥi], ” two times,  as first it is written: “You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice [zivḥi] with leavened bread” (Exodus 23:18) and then it is written again: “You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice [zivḥi] with leavened bread” (Exodus 34:25).

The heretic raised a question: It should have stated: Come up to Me.  Rav Idit said to him: This term, “YHWH,” in that verse is referring to the angel Metatron, whose name is like the name of his Master, as it is written:  “Behold I send an angel before you to keep you in the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared. Take heed of him and obey his voice; do not defy him; for he will not pardon your transgression, for My name is in him” (Exodus 23:20–21)."

But in another verse it is written: “And its staves shall be put into the rings” (Exodus 27:7), implying that when the Ark is used the staves are inserted, which suggests that they do not remain there permanently. How is this contradiction resolved? The staves could be removed from their position, i.e., they were loosened, but did not come out.  The staves were wider at their ends and thinner in the middle. Therefore, once they had been forced into the rings, although they could be shifted, they would not be removed entirely."

Similarly, the verse: “And you will make a Candelabrum of pure gold; of beaten work shall the Candelabrum be made, even its base, its shaft, its goblets, its knobs, and its flowers” (Exodus 25:31), teaches that if the Candelabrum is fashioned of gold it must be fashioned with goblets, knobs, and flowers,  and if it is not fashioned of gold but of other types of metal, then it does not need to be fashioned with goblets, knobs, and flowers.

From where is it derived to include its lamps,  that they should also be fashioned together with the frame from the same talent? The verse states:  “It shall be fashioned with all these vessels. ” This indicates that not only the frame, but also additional parts should be fashioned from the same talent.

This verse juxtaposes the altar to the Tabernacle.  It is derived that just as the Tabernacle was ten cubits high, so too,  the altar was ten cubits high.

But in another verse it is written: “And its staves shall be put into the rings” (Exodus 27:7), implying that when the Ark is used the staves are inserted, which suggests that they do not remain there permanently. How is this contradiction resolved? The staves could be removed from their position, i.e., they were loosened, but did not come out.  The staves were wider at their ends and thinner in the middle. Therefore, once they had been forced into the rings, although they could be shifted, they would not be removed entirely."

This baraita contradicts Rav Kahana’s opinion, as according to all of the opinions in the baraita, the division of the names on the ephod is not identical to the division of the tribes on Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal. The Talmud confirms: The refutation of the opinion of Rav Kahana is in fact a conclusive refutation. "

Although one does not don tefillin on Shabbat and going out donning them involves an element of carrying, there is no concern lest he forget and remove them on Shabbat. What is the reason for this? Because Rabba bar Rav Huna said: A person is obligated to touch his tefillin at all times that he is donning them. This is derived from an a fortiori inference [kal vaḥomer] from the frontplate [tzitz] of the High Priest. Just as with regard to the frontplate, which has only one mention of God’s name, the Torah said: “And it should be always upon his forehead” (Exodus 28:38), which means that the High Priest must always be aware that the tzitz is placed on his head and that he should not be distracted from it; tefillin that have numerous mentions of God’s name, all the more so one should always be aware of them. Therefore, he remembers that the tefillin are on his head and is not likely to come to carry them on Shabbat. On a related note, the Talmud mentions that it was taught in a baraita that Ḥananya says: A person is required to feel his clothing on Shabbat eve at nightfall to ascertain whether he forgot an object in his pockets that he might come to carry on Shabbat. And Rav Yosef commented and said:  That is a significant halakha for Shabbat,  and it is fitting to do so in order to refrain from violating a prohibition."

That was also taught in a baraita: The verse states: “For I am God Who sanctifies you, ” meaning that God said to Moses: I have a good gift in My treasure house and Shabbat is its name, and I seek to give it to Israel. Go inform them about it. From here Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: One who gives a gift of bread to a child needs to inform his mother that he gave it to him. The Talmud asks: What does he do to the child, so that his mother will know that he gave him a gift? Abaye said: He should smear him with oil or place blue shadow around his eye in an obvious manner. When the mother of the child notices and asks him about it, he will tell her that so-and-so gave him a piece of bread. The Talmud asks: And now that we are concerned about witchcraft involving oil or eye shadow, what should one who gives a gift do? Rav Pappa said: He should smear him with food of the same type that he gave him to eat."

The Talmud asks: From where do we derive the division of labors?  What is the source of the halakha that if one performs numerous prohibited labors on Shabbat in the course of one lapse of awareness, each prohibited labor is considered a separate offense with regard to punishment? Shmuel said that the verse says:  “And you shall observe the Shabbat, for it is holy to you; he who desecrates it shall surely die [mot yumat]” (Exodus 31:14). We learn from the double language, mot yumat, that the Torah amplified multiple deaths for a single desecration.  Although several violations were committed in the course of a single lapse of awareness, each is considered a separate offense with regard to punishment. The Talmud asks: That verse was written with regard to intentional transgression. The Talmud is seeking a source for multiple sacrifices brought for unwitting transgression. The Talmud answers: If it does not refer to the matter of intentional transgression, as the verse does not teach a halakha applicable to intentional acts, as it was already written:  “Six days you shall perform work, and on the 7th day it shall be holy to you, a Shabbat of rest to God; all who desecrate it shall die” (Exodus 35:2), refer it to the matter of unwitting transgression. The verse teaches that that which was written with regard to the death penalty for desecration of Shabbat in general applies to all halakhot of Shabbat, including cases of unwitting transgression. And what,  then, is the meaning of the term: Shall die,  in the verse? Does it mean that one who commits an unwitting transgression is punishable by death? It means that he shall die by payment of money.  Death is used in the sense of punishment; he will be forced to pay for numerous sacrifices to atone for his sins."

Isn’t it only for the sake of Israel,  so that you may serve as an emissary, that I granted you prominence; and now that Israel has sinned, why do I need you?  There is no need for an emissary. Immediately, Moses’ strength waned and he was powerless to speak in defense of Israel. And once God said to Moses: “Leave Me be, that I may destroy them” (Deuteronomy 9:14), Moses said to himself: If God is telling me to let Him be, it must be because this matter is dependent upon me.

It is stated in Aaron’s response: “And I cast it into the fire and this calf came forth” (Exodus 32:24). This formulation implies that the calf came from the fire by itself, suggesting that it had divine power and substance."

What is the reason for when punishments are annulled? Because the Jewish people blessed God.  When one recites: Amen, may His great name be blessed, and blesses God, his punishment is annulled. R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said that R' Yoḥanan said: Even if one has within him a trace of idolatry,  when he answers amen he is forgiven. It is written here,  in the verse above: “When punishments [pera’ot] are annulled. ” And it is written there,  with regard to the sin of the Golden Calf: “And Moses saw that the nation was wild [paru’a],  for Aaron had let them loose for anyone who might rise against them” (Exodus 32:25). Even one with the wildness of idolatry is forgiven. Reish Lakish said: One who answers amen with all his strength, they open the gates of the Garden of Eden before him, as it is stated: “Open the gates, and a righteous nation shall come who keeps the faith” (Isaiah 26:2).

The Talmud asks: From where do we derive the division of labors?  What is the source of the halakha that if one performs numerous prohibited labors on Shabbat in the course of one lapse of awareness, each prohibited labor is considered a separate offense with regard to punishment? Shmuel said that the verse says:  “And you shall observe the Shabbat, for it is holy to you; he who desecrates it shall surely die [mot yumat]” (Exodus 31:14). We learn from the double language, mot yumat, that the Torah amplified multiple deaths for a single desecration.  Although several violations were committed in the course of a single lapse of awareness, each is considered a separate offense with regard to punishment. The Talmud asks: That verse was written with regard to intentional transgression. The Talmud is seeking a source for multiple sacrifices brought for unwitting transgression. The Talmud answers: If it does not refer to the matter of intentional transgression, as the verse does not teach a halakha applicable to intentional acts, as it was already written:  “Six days you shall perform work, and on the 7th day it shall be holy to you, a Shabbat of rest to God; all who desecrate it shall die” (Exodus 35:2), refer it to the matter of unwitting transgression. The verse teaches that that which was written with regard to the death penalty for desecration of Shabbat in general applies to all halakhot of Shabbat, including cases of unwitting transgression. And what,  then, is the meaning of the term: Shall die,  in the verse? Does it mean that one who commits an unwitting transgression is punishable by death? It means that he shall die by payment of money.  Death is used in the sense of punishment; he will be forced to pay for numerous sacrifices to atone for his sins."

Why kindle the fire while it is still day? Rather, Rav Ḥisda said,  it should be understood as follows: When the verse came, it came to permit burning the limbs and fats of the sacrifices on the altar, even on Shabbat. Lighting the bonfire of the Chamber of the Hearth was not permitted on Shabbat itself, since it is not part of the Temple service. It was kindled merely for the benefit of the priests. The fact that there was no concern about lighting the bonfire on Shabbat eve at nightfall is because the priests are vigilant with regard to mitzvot, and they will certainly not come to stoke the coals."

It was singled out in order to equate the other labors to it and to tell you: Just as kindling is a primary category of prohibited labor, and one is liable for performing it on its own, so too,  with regard to every primary category of prohibited labor, one is liable for performing it on its own.

Rav Kahana said: This is not a typical manner of shearing, and this is not a typical manner of combing, and this is not a typical manner of spinning.  The Talmud asks: And is that not a typical manner of spinning? Wasn’t it taught in a baraita in the name of R' Neḥemya that the verse in the context of the work of the Tabernacle: “And all the women whose hearts lifted them with wisdom spun the goats” (Exodus 35:26) means that they washed the hair on the goats, and they spun it into threads on the goats themselves without first shearing the hair?

He must have been at least thirteen years old, as it is written:  “And all the wise men that carried out all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work that they did” (Exodus 36:4), and one who is less than thirteen is not called a man. And it is taught in a baraita: In the first year following the exodus from Egypt Moses made the Tabernacle; in the second year he erected the Tabernacle and sent out the spies. "

It may be argued as follows: From the fact that when the Bible speaks of Nisan,  which is the first month, it calls it “the second year, ” and when it speaks of the following Iyyar,  which is the second month, it also calls it “the second year, ” by inference, Rosh HaShana is not at the beginning of Iyyar.  Were it the case that the New Year begins in Iyyar, Nisan and the following Iyyar would not occur in the same year, as the year would have changed in Iyyar."

It was taught: That day took ten crowns.  It was the first day of Creation,  meaning Sunday, the first day of the offerings brought by the princes, the first day of the priesthood, the first day of service in the Temple, the first time for the descent of fire onto the altar, the first time that consecrated foods were eaten, the first day of the resting of the Shekhina upon the Jewish people, the first day that the Jewish people were blessed by the priests, and the first day of the prohibition to bring offerings on improvised altars.  Once the Tabernacle was erected, it was prohibited to offer sacrifices elsewhere. And it was the first of the months. And from the fact that the New Moon of Nisan of that year was on the first day of the week,  in the previous year,  it was on the 4th day of the week. "

Just as below,  with regard to the Tabernacle, the tent was made of linen and is considered a tent, so too, here,  with regard to the halakhot of ritual impurity imparted by a corpse, only a tent made of linen is considered a tent.  The Talmud asks: If so, derive the following from that same verbal analogy: Just as below the linen threads in the Tabernacle were specifically threads that were twisted and the threads were folded six times, so too, here,  in all of the halakhot pertaining to a tent over a corpse, the threads must be twisted and their threads folded six times. The verse states the word tent, tent several times to amplify and include even a tent made of linen not identical to the Tabernacle. The Talmud asks: If the repetition of the word tent, tent several times amplifies, even all things should be included among those items that can receive ritual impurity as a tent. The Talmud answers: This amplification cannot be that far-reaching, as, if so,  the verbal analogy of tent, tent, that teaches us to derive the tent over a corpse from the Tabernacle, what purpose does it serve if everything is included? Rather, certainly the amplification is not absolute. Through the combination of the verbal analogy and the amplification, it is derived that this halakha applies specifically to linen."

If Moses was capable of standing and spreading the cover over the tent by himself, he must have been at least ten cubits tall. Presumably, that was the height of the rest of the Levites as well. And they learned through tradition that every burden that is carried with poles, one-3rd of the burden is above the porter’s height, and two-thirds are below his height. It is found,  then, that the altar was very high,  as if they carried the altar on poles, the bottom of the altar was at least one-3rd of ten cubits, twenty handbreadths, off the ground."
