If so, there is no room for concern with regard to the meat of the Paschal lamb, which must be either a goat or a lamb (Exodus 12:5). The Talmud answers: In any case, it is necessary to emphasize the vigilance of the members of the group, as <b>there, </b> where it was permitted, it was specifically in a case that the goat <b>was cut</b> into pieces. However, <b>here, </b> with regard to the Paschal lamb, the goat <b>is not cut</b> into pieces. It is roasted whole, in accordance with the <i>halakhot</i> of the Paschal lamb. Consequently, it does not roast quickly, and there is room for concern lest he stoke the coals in order to accelerate the roasting. However, since the members of the group are vigilant, the rabbis permitted it."

          "talmudFullText": "Speaking of judgment, the Talmud relates that <b>Rav Ami and Rav Asi would sit and study between the pillars</b> beneath the study hall. <b>And each and every hour they would knock on the bolt of the door and say: If there is</b> someone <b>who</b> has a case that <b>requires judgment, let him enter and come</b> before us. The Talmud also relates that <b>Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna would sit in judgment all day and their hearts would grow weak</b> from hunger. Therefore, <b>Rav Ḥiyya bar Rav from Difti taught them</b> a <i>baraita</i> with regard to the verse: “And it was the next day and Moses sat to judge the people <b>and the people stood over Moses from the morning until the evening”</b> (Exodus 18:13). <b>Does it enter your mind that Moses would sit and judge all day long? </b> If so, <b>when was his Torah</b> study <b>accomplished? Rather, </b> surely the verse is coming <b>to tell you: Any judge who judges a true judgment truthfully, even if</b> he sits in judgment only <b>one hour, the verse ascribes to him as if he became a partner to God in the act of Creation, </b> as by means of a true judgment he upholds the world (<i>Me’iri</i>). This conclusion is derived by means of a verbal analogy [<i>gezera shava</i>]: <b>It is written here: “And the people stood over Moses from the morning until the evening. ” And it is written there, </b> in the act of Creation: <b>“And it was evening and it was morning, one day”</b> (Genesis 1:5). The evening and part of the morning are considered a whole day. With regard to this issue as well, it is sufficient for the judges to sit in judgment for only part of the day and there is no need for them to starve themselves by sitting in judgment all day."

Because the semen remains fit for insemination, it can transmit impurity, <b>as it is stated</b> prior to the revelation at Sinai: “And he said to the people, <b>prepare yourselves for three days, </b> do not approach a woman” (Exodus 19:15). This three-day separation period ensured that even a woman who discharged semen would be pure. The Mishnah cites another <i>halakha</i> based on a biblical allusion: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may wash the circumcision on the 3rd day, </b> meaning the 3rd day after the circumcision, even if <b>it occurs on Shabbat? As it is stated: “And it came to pass on the 3rd day when they were in pain”</b> (Genesis 34:25). The pain of circumcision lasts at least three days, and as long as the child is in pain he is considered to be in danger. The Mishnah cites another <i>halakha</i> with an allusion in the Bible: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one ties a scarlet strip</b> of wool <b>to the head of</b> the <b>scapegoat</b> that is dispatched to Azazel? <b>As it is stated: “If your sins be like scarlet, they will become white like snow”</b> (Isaiah 1:18). Since the goat is offered to atone for sins, red wool is tied to its horns. The Mishnah cites another allusion. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that smearing</b> oil on one’s body <b>is like drinking</b> and is similarly prohibited <b>on Yom Kippur? Although there is no proof for this, there is an allusion to it, as it is stated: “And it comes into his inward parts like water and like oil into his bones”</b> (Psalms 109:18). The verse appears to equate smearing oil on one’s body with drinking water."

The Talmud explains: <b>And both of them expounded the same verse</b> to arrive at their respective opinions: “And <b>the Festival of the Ingathering at the turn of the year”</b> (Exodus 34:22). They both interpret the verse to mean that the Festival of the Ingathering, which is referring to the intermediate days of <i>Sukkot</i>, must take place during the season of Tishrei, i.e., autumn. One <b>Sage, </b> R' Yehuda, <b>holds</b> that <b>we require all of the Festival</b> to take place <b>in the new season, </b> after the equinox. <b>And</b> one <b>Sage, </b> R' Yosei, <b>holds</b> that <b>we require</b> only <b>some of the Festival, </b> even one day, to take place <b>in the new season, </b> so the year must be intercalated only if the equinox would fall on the 22nd of Tishrei or later."

The Talmud asks: <b>That</b> verse <b>was written with regard to intentional</b> transgression. The Talmud is seeking a source for multiple sacrifices brought for unwitting transgression. The Talmud answers: <b>If it does not</b> refer to <b>the matter</b> of <b>intentional</b> transgression, as the verse does not teach a <i>halakha</i> applicable to intentional acts, <b>as it was</b> already <b>written: </b> “Six days you shall perform work, and on the 7th day it shall be holy to you, a Shabbat of rest to God; <b>all who desecrate</b> it <b>shall die”</b> (Exodus 35:2), <b>refer it to the matter of unwitting</b> transgression. The verse teaches that that which was written with regard to the death penalty for desecration of Shabbat in general applies to all <i>halakhot</i> of Shabbat, including cases of unwitting transgression. <b>And what, </b> then, is the meaning of the term: <b>Shall die, </b> in the verse? Does it mean that one who commits an unwitting transgression is punishable by death? It means that <b>he shall die by</b> payment of <b>money. </b> Death is used in the sense of punishment; he will be forced to pay for numerous sacrifices to atone for his sins."
