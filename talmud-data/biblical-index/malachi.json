The rabbis say: Baladan was a king, and his visage was transformed and became like that of a dog. His son was sitting on the throne in his stead and when he would write a letter he would write his name and the name of his father, King Baladan. That is the meaning of that which is written with regard to the honor accorded by non-Jews to their fathers: “A son honors his father and a servant his master” (Malachi 1:6)."

And if you wish, say that actually his statement serves to exclude wine that has been left uncovered, and it teaches the novelty that even though one passes it through a sieve, in accordance with the opinion of R' Neḥemya (see Terumot 8:7), nevertheless,  it still may not be used for the sanctification of the Shabbat day. This is because it is disrespectful to use inferior wine for a mitzva, as derived from the verse in which God rebukes the Jewish people for offering lame animals as offerings: “Present it now unto your governor; will he be pleased with you or will he accept your person?  says YHWH of hosts” (Malachi 1:8)."

The Talmud asks: But since he removes it from the thigh, why does he bring it up to the altar? The Talmud answers that one cannot bring the thigh up to the altar after the sciatic nerve has been removed because it is stated with regard to one who sacrifices offerings that are damaged or unattractive: “Present it now unto your governor;  will he be pleased with you, or will he accept your person? says YHWH of hosts” (Malachi 1:8). Consequently, the leg of the animal must be brought up to the altar while it is whole, and the sciatic nerve must be removed on top of the altar."

Even if it is possible to render this water potable, it is certainly not of the select quality that would render it eligible for use in the Temple service.

Based on the juxtaposition in the verse, it is derived that the legal status of a stolen animal is equivalent to that of a lame animal. Just as a lame animal, because it is blemished, has no remedy and is unfit for use, so too, a stolen animal has no remedy.  There is no difference before the owners reach a state of despair of recovering the stolen animal, and there is no difference after despair.  In both cases there is no remedy."

Moses evaded the question and said to him: And what am I that God would have given me the Torah?  I am unworthy. God said to Moses: Moses, are you a fabricator?  Moses said before Him: God!, You have a hidden treasure in which You delight every day,  as it is stated: “And I was His delight every day, playing before Him at every moment” (Proverbs 8:30). Should I take credit for myself and say that You gave it to me? God said to Moses: Since you belittled yourself,  the Torah will be called by your name, as it is stated: “Remember the Torah of Moses My servant to whom I commanded at Horeb laws and statutes for all of Israel” (Malachi 3:22)."

          "talmudFullText": "R' Shimon ben Pazi said that R' Yehoshua ben Levi said in the name of bar Kappara: Anyone who fulfills the obligation to eat three meals on Shabbat is rescued from three punishments: From the pangs of the Messiah,  i.e., the suffering that precedes the advent of Messiah, and from the judgment of Gehenna, and from the war of Gog and Magog.  The Talmud derives that one is rescued from the pangs of Messiah by means of a verbal analogy. It is written here,  with regard to Shabbat, day:  “Eat it today” (Exodus 16:25). And it is written there,  with regard to Messiah, day: “Behold, I am sending you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and awesome day of God” (Malachi 3:23). The Talmud derives that one is rescued from the judgment of Gehenna by means of a verbal analogy. It is written here,  with regard to Shabbat, day,  as cited above. And it is written there,  day: “That day will be a day of wrath,  a day of trouble and distress, a day of destruction and desolation, a day of darkness and blackness, a day of cloud and thick fog” (Zephaniah 1:15), which is interpreted as referring to the punishment of Gehenna. The Talmud derives that one is rescued from the war of Gog and Magog by means of a verbal analogy. It is written here,  with regard to Shabbat, day. And it is written there,  with regard to the War of Gog and Magog, day: “And it shall be on that day, on the day that Gog arrives on the land of Israel” (Ezekiel 38:18)."
