So says YHWH God concerning Edom:  We have heard a message from YHWH, and an ambassador is sent among the nations: Arise, and let us rise up against her in battle” (Obadiah 1:1). The Talmud asks: What is different,  i.e., what is the reason, that specifically Obadiah prophesied concerning Edom? "

          "talmudFullText": "The Talmud asks: And do the Romans actually appoint as king the son of the king? But didn’t Rav Yosef teach:  The verse relating a prophesy about Edom, associated with the Roman Empire: “Behold, I made you small among the nations” (Obadiah 1:2), is a reference to the fact that the Romans do not place on the throne as king the son of the king.  The continuation of the verse: “You are greatly despised, ” is a reference to the fact that the Romans have neither their own script nor their own language,  but use those of other nations. The Talmud therefore rejects the explanation of the baraita that distinguishes between coronation of a king and coronation of the king’s son: Rather, what is the day of geinuseya?  It is the king’s birthday. "

          "talmudFullText": "An example of identical content expressed in different styles is the prophecy where Obadiah said: “The pride of your heart has beguiled you” (Obadiah 1:3), and Jeremiah said a similar message employing slightly different language: “Your terribleness has deceived you, even the pride of your heart” (Jeremiah 49:16). And with regard to these false prophets, from the fact that in their case all the prophets are saying their prophecies like each other,  i.e., employing an identical style, conclude from it that they are saying nothing of substance and that it is a false prophecy."

          "talmudFullText": "And Shmuel says: Maveh, this is the category of Eating, as it is written: “How is Esau searched out [neḥpesu]; how are his hidden places revealed [nivu]” (Obadiah 1:6)? The terms nivu and maveh share a common root. The Talmud asks: From where may it be inferred that nivu connotes Eating? The Talmud explains that it is as Rav Yosef translates the verse into Aramaic: How is Esau searched out [itbelish]; how are his hidden places revealed [itgaleyan]?  The meaning of the Aramaic term itgaleyan means revealed, and that is the meaning of the Hebrew term “nivu. ” Maveh references the animal’s teeth, which are covered when its mouth is closed and revealed when it eats."

And mazor means nothing other than afflictions,  based on the parallel with another verse, as it is stated: “And Ephraim saw his sickness and Judah his wound [mezoro]” (Hosea 5:13). This indicates that one who gives his bread to one without discernment will ultimately fall ill."

Antoninus said to him: But isn’t it written: “And there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau” (Obadiah 1:18)? R' Yehuda HaNasi answered: The verse is stated with regard to those who perform actions similar to those of the wicked Esau,  not to people like you."

What was different when Joseph was born,  that Jacob decided only then to return home? R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani said to him: Jacob our patriarch saw prophetically that the descendants of Esau will be delivered only to the hand of the descendants of Joseph, as it is stated: “And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for straw,  and they shall kindle in them, and devour them” (Obadiah 1:18). Jacob had left Eretz Yisrael to escape Esau, but he now felt confident that he could return without endangering his family."
