R' Yehuda derives this <i>halakha</i> from the phrase: “And she shall speak and say: So” (Deuteronomy 25:9). The Talmud asks: <b>And what do the Rabbis do with, </b> i.e., how do they interpret, <b>this</b> word <b>“so”? They require</b> it <b>to</b> teach that any <b>matter</b> detailed in the portion <b>that is an action is indispensable</b> to the <i>ḥalitza</i> ceremony, as the verse states: “So shall it be done. ” However, the other aspects of the ritual, e.g., the recitations, are not indispensable, and in their absence the ritual is valid after the fact."

This is as it is written: “And there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for bondsmen and bondswomen, </b> and no man shall buy you” (Deuteronomy 28:68). The repetitive nature of the verse, indicating that no one will be willing to buy you for servitude, but they will purchase you in order to murder you, indicates a doubly horrific situation, which is symbolized by the dual term <i>vayhi</i>, meaning woe and mourning."
