The verse states: “And this shall be the priests’ due [mishpat]” (Deuteronomy 18:3), which teaches that the gifts given to the priests are considered a judgment,  as mishpat can mean judgment. The Talmud continues: With regard to what halakha are the gifts a judgment? Is it not with regard to extracting them through judges,  i.e., a priest may claim them in court and the court will order the individual to give the gifts to that priest? If so, the gifts are considered to be money that has claimants. The Talmud rejects this suggestion: No,  they are a judgment with regard to distributing them through judges,  i.e., the court dictates to the owner to which type of priests he should give the gifts."

The Talmud asks: And the Rabbis,  who derive other halakhot from this phrase, from where do they derive to divide between an ox and a sheep? The Talmud responds: They derive it from the phrase: “From them that perform a slaughter” (Deuteronomy 18:3), which indicates that the obligation to give the gifts applies even to one animal."

But when the verse mentions a priest with regard to gifts of the priesthood, it means to include even a female priest.  This is because the verse mentions priests twice: “And this shall be the priests’ due from the people, from them that perform a slaughter, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3). Since each reference to a priest excludes the daughter of a priest, this verse is a case of a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression, and there is a hermeneutical principle that a restrictive expression following a restrictive expression serves only to amplify the halakha and include additional cases, in this instance, the daughter of a priest."

And I resolved this question for him from the verse: “That they shall give to the priest the foreleg, and the jaw, and the maw” (Deuteronomy 18:3).

The superfluous mention of “first” signals that the two issues discussed in this verse, which are the first fruits, i.e., teruma, and the first sheared wool, are two separate matters. Therefore, one cannot derive the halakhot of one from the other."

Therefore, the verse states: “Besides the transactions of their fathers’ houses” (Deuteronomy 18:8). What did the forefathers of each watch sell each other?  They agreed with regard to the service of the watches: I will serve during my week, and you will serve during your week.  Each watch has the right to perform the Temple service during its appointed weeks and to receive all priestly gifts offered during those weeks."

It means that you shall not cross the border that the early generations set,  establishing the parameters necessary for each plant. The Talmud asks: What is the meaning of the phrase: The early generations set? R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani said that R' Yonatan said: What is the meaning of that which was written: “These are the sons of Seir the Horite who inhabit the land,  Lotan and Shoval and Zibeon and Ana” (Genesis 36:20)? And is everyone else inhabitants of the heavens,  that it was necessary for the verse to emphasize that these inhabit the land? Rather,  it means that they were experts in the settlement of the land, as they would say: This tract of land that is the full length of a rod is fit for olive trees; this full length of a rod is fit for grapes, this full length of a rod is fit for figs. And the members of this tribe were called Horites [ḥori] since they smelled [heriḥu] the earth to determine what is fit to be grown there. The allusion is based on a transposition of the letters ḥet and reish. And in explanation of why the early inhabitants of Seir were called Hivites [ḥivi] (see Genesis 36:2), Rav Pappa said:  Because they would taste the earth like a snake [ḥivya] and determine what should be grown there according to the taste. Rav Aḥa bar Ya’akov said that they were called Horites [ḥori] because they became free [benei ḥorin] of their possessions when the children of Esau drove them from their lands. Their primary name was actually Hivites."

The Talmud answers: It serves to exclude a case involving testimony that a girl has reached majority, in which one witness says that he saw one hair on her lower back, and one witness says that he saw one hair on her lower abdomen.  A girl is considered to have reached maturity when she has two pubic hairs.

Rather,  Ulla’s question is: From where is an allusion in the Torah to the halakha that conspiring witnesses are flogged in certain cases derived? It is derived from that which is written:  “If there is a quarrel between people and they come to judgment, and the judges judge them, and they vindicated the righteous and condemned the wicked, and it shall be if the wicked is deserving of lashes” (Deuteronomy 25:1–2). Ostensibly, this verse is difficult: Is it due to the fact that “they vindicated the righteous” that they “condemned the wicked, and it shall be if the wicked is deserving of lashes”?  In most disputes, the fact that one party is vindicated does not necessarily lead to lashes for the other party."

If the witnesses testified about someone that he owes another person two hundred dinars and they were then found to be conspiring witnesses, the witnesses divide the sum among themselves and pay a total of two hundred dinars.

The Talmud asks: If so,  in the case of money too,  one should not divide the sum between them, as each sought to cause the defendant loss of the entire sum.

Just as the officers described are those who have been appointed to discharge their responsibilities, so too, the priest described is one who has been appointed for this role. The Talmud asks: But if so, why not say that the High Priest should deliver this address, as he is also appointed? The Talmud replies: The appointed priest must be similar to an appointed officer. Just as an officer is one who has someone else, i.e., a judge, with greater authority appointed above him, so too, the priest described must be one who has someone else, i.e., the High Priest, appointed above him.

This verse teaches that you are permitted to purchase the child as a slave, as he is not included in the mitzva “You shall save alive nothing that breathes” that was stated with regard to full-fledged Canaanites.

Consequently, just as deriving benefit from the heifer whose neck is broken is prohibited from the time of its selection, so too must deriving benefit from these birds be prohibited from the time of their selection. Clearly, then, R' Shimon ben Lakish holds that deriving benefit from the heifer whose neck is broken is prohibited while it is still alive. Therefore, its slaughter is one that does not render the animal fit for consumption. Accordingly, R' Shimon would exempt its slaughterer from the prohibition of: Itself and its offspring, as is taught in the Mishnah."

A minor under the age of thirteen is exempt from the penalty imposed upon a stubborn and rebellious son, because he has not yet reached the age of inclusion in mitzvot. "

And the meaning of the word “chastise” in the latter verse is derived from the word “son” that appears in the same verse. And the meaning of the word “son [ben]” with regard to a rebellious son is derived from the similar word “bin” stated with regard to lashes: “Then it shall be if the wicked man deserves [bin] to be flogged” (Deuteronomy 25:2). Consequently, the chastisement mentioned with regard to both a defamer and a rebellious son involves flogging."

From where do I derive that even if one returns it to his garden or to his ruin,  i.e., an unused structure on his property, he has discharged his obligation and is no longer responsible for the item that he found?

It is derived from this verse, as it is written:  “And so shall you do with his donkey; and so shall you do with his garment; and so shall you do with every lost item of your brother, which shall be lost from him, and you have found it” (Deuteronomy 22:3).

Accordingly, one should apply here the principle that the mitzva to send away the mother bird from the nest applies only in the case described in the verse: “If a bird’s nest happens before you” (Deuteronomy 22:6), which excludes from the mitzva a bird or egg readily available in one’s home.

But could one not derive this by logical inference,  reaching the opposite conclusion: The Torah rendered one obligated here not to slaughter an animal and its offspring in a single day, and the Torah rendered one obligated with regard to a mother bird with its chicks not to seize them together, but to dispatch the mother. Just as when it rendered one obligated with regard to a mother bird with its chicks,  the obligation applies to female birds but not to males,  as the verse states: “And the mother sitting on the chicks” (Deuteronomy 22:6), so too, when it rendered one obligated here,  with regard to an animal and its offspring, the obligation should apply to female animals, but not to males.

Consequently, according to the one who holds this verbal analogy, one extra hillul remains from which to derive the blessing.

He sought to prove that the halakhot of prohibited mixtures of threads apply only to wool and linen.

The fact that the prohibition is limited to wool and linen is explicitly written,  as it is stated: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, wool and linen together” (Deuteronomy 22:11).

This comes to include the law of ritual fringes;  the obligation of ritual fringes applies only to those materials. The Talmud asks: Why is that derivation necessary? With regard to ritual fringes it is written explicitly: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, wool and linen together” (Deuteronomy 22:11); and juxtaposed to it, it is written: “You shall make for you twisted fringes upon the four corners of your covering, with which you cover yourself” (Deuteronomy 22:12). From the juxtaposition of these two verses it is derived that the mitzva of ritual fringes applies only to garments to which the laws of diverse kinds apply. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak responded that the matter is not so clear, as it could have entered your mind to say in accordance with the statement of Rava. As Rava raised a contradiction:  On the one hand, it is written:  “And that they put with the fringe of each corner a thread of sky blue” (Numbers 15:39); apparently, the threads of the ritual fringes must be of the same type of fabric as the corner of the garment. However,  in Deuteronomy, in the laws of ritual fringes, it is written in juxtaposition to the laws of diverse kinds: Wool and linen together.  The ritual fringes may only be made of those materials. How can that contradiction be resolved? Rather, Rava says: Ritual fringes made of wool and linen exempt the garment and fulfill the obligation of ritual fringes whether the garment is of their own type,  wool or linen, whether it is not of their own type.  Whereas with regard to other types,  a garment of their own type, they exempt;  a garment not of their own type, they do not exempt. It would have entered your mind to explain this in accordance with the approach of Rava.

He would then take the eight strings and loop them through the four loops and pull them tight, thereby attaching them to the garment. The Talmud explains that he held that we require eight strings when they are initially placed in the garment, in order that there be twisted cord and “twisted cords” (Deuteronomy 22:12), i.e., four doubled strings, at the place,  i.e., the time, when he creates the loose hanging string.

This comes to include the law of ritual fringes;  the obligation of ritual fringes applies only to those materials. The Talmud asks: Why is that derivation necessary? With regard to ritual fringes it is written explicitly: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, wool and linen together” (Deuteronomy 22:11); and juxtaposed to it, it is written: “You shall make for you twisted fringes upon the four corners of your covering, with which you cover yourself” (Deuteronomy 22:12). From the juxtaposition of these two verses it is derived that the mitzva of ritual fringes applies only to garments to which the laws of diverse kinds apply. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak responded that the matter is not so clear, as it could have entered your mind to say in accordance with the statement of Rava. As Rava raised a contradiction:  On the one hand, it is written:  “And that they put with the fringe of each corner a thread of sky blue” (Numbers 15:39); apparently, the threads of the ritual fringes must be of the same type of fabric as the corner of the garment. However,  in Deuteronomy, in the laws of ritual fringes, it is written in juxtaposition to the laws of diverse kinds: Wool and linen together.  The ritual fringes may only be made of those materials. How can that contradiction be resolved? Rather, Rava says: Ritual fringes made of wool and linen exempt the garment and fulfill the obligation of ritual fringes whether the garment is of their own type,  wool or linen, whether it is not of their own type.  Whereas with regard to other types,  a garment of their own type, they exempt;  a garment not of their own type, they do not exempt. It would have entered your mind to explain this in accordance with the approach of Rava.  Therefore, the tanna taught us that the obligation of ritual fringes applies only to wool and linen and not to other materials."

R' Akiva says: She receives payment of a fine for her rape, and her fine goes to her father,  contrary to the ruling attributed to R' Akiva in the Mishnah. And ostensibly, no verse is required to derive this halakha, as logic dictates that it is so: Since her father is entitled to the money of her betrothal if she is betrothed before she becomes a grown woman, and likewise her father is entitled to the money of her fine; just as the money of her subsequent betrothal as a young woman, even though she was betrothed and divorced,  is paid to her father, so too, the money of her fine, although she was betrothed and divorced,  is paid to her father.

Consequently, if the father dies before receiving the money, he does not bequeath his right to the money to his sons. Instead, the daughter is considered to take her father’s place as the plaintiff, because she was the victim, and the money is paid to her."

And if you would say: Let us derive this halakha from the fine paid by the rapist of a young woman, which the Torah explicitly states goes to her father (Deuteronomy 22:29), there is another principle, that we do not derive monetary matters from fines.

Or perhaps one should consider the following: What is the reason that the marriage contract was enacted? So that his wife will not be demeaned in his eyes such that he will easily divorce her. And this one,  his rape victim, he cannot divorce her by Torah law, as it is stated: “He may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:29). It was therefore unnecessary for the rabbis to require that he provide the woman with a marriage contract. However, the reasons for the stipulations included in a marriage contract, e.g., that his daughter receives sustenance from his estate, still apply in this case. Consequently, the rabbis stipulated that these provisions still be granted. Yet again the Talmud states that the dilemma shall stand unresolved."

This comparison serves to exclude a second-generation Egyptian, whose offspring is not unfit, as the verse states: “The children of the 3rd generation that are born to them may enter into the congregation of YHWH” (Deuteronomy 23:9).

In fact, it was necessary to teach this point, as it may enter your mind to say that since it is written in the verse: “If there be among you any man that is not clean because of something that happens to him by night” (Deuteronomy 23:11), this means that a seminal emission is ritually impure if it came from someone who had something happen to him,  and this causes him to experience the emission, but the verse is excluding this zav, who did not have something happen to him to cause him to experience the emission, but rather another matter,  i.e., his gonorrhea-like condition, caused him to experience the emission.

We can infer that this prohibits speech [dibbur] but not contemplation. The Talmud answers: That verse is not referring to speech. It is needed for the ruling of Rav Yehuda, for Rav Yehuda said: Opposite a naked non-Jew, it is prohibited to recite Shema,  as this is included in the prohibition of unseemly things mentioned above."

Although the rabbis said that one is required to separate tithes from demai, they allowed it to be used for specific purposes and in exigent circumstances. And they said that one may separate the tithe from demai when he is naked and at dusk Shabbat eve, a time when separating tithes from actual untithed produce [tevel] is prohibited. And if you say that every action instituted by rabbinic ordinance requires a blessing,  as fulfillment of rabbinic ordinances is based on the mitzva: You shall not turn aside, here, when he stands naked, how can he recite a blessing? Don’t we require fulfillment of the mitzva: “Therefore shall your camp be holy;  that He see no unseemly thing in you, and turn away from you” (Deuteronomy 23:15)? And the camp is not holy when one recites a blessing in a state of nakedness. Abaye said:  There is room to distinguish between the cases: In a case where there is a definite mitzva by rabbinic law, a blessing is required.  In a case where there is a rabbinic ordinance instituted due to uncertainty with regard to the circumstances, as in the case of demai, which may or may not have been tithed already, a blessing is not required.

In this case too, despite the fact that the court cannot compel one to pay for the produce his cow ate, he does owe this sum. Furthermore, if the owner of the produce were to seize this sum from him, the court would not force him to return the money."

This is because they are considered “the price of a dog,” as it states in the Torah (Deuteronomy 23:19), since they were given in exchange for it. Nevertheless, the nine lambs that were taken with the dog are permitted for sacrifice. The Talmud explains the objection: And if you say that there is retroactive designation,  why are all ten lambs prohibited?

The ruling concerning birds needs to be stated as, by right, it should have been permitted based on the following a fortiori inference: What? If consecrated animals, for which a blemish disqualifies them for use, may nevertheless be used as an offering, since the status of a prostitute’s payment or the status of a dog’s price does not take effect upon them,  then with regard to birds,  for which a blemish does not disqualify them for use as an offering, is it not logically right that the status of a prostitute’s payment or a dog’s price should not take effect upon them?  In repudiation of this argument, the verse states:  “You shall not bring the payment of a prostitute, or the price of a dog, into the House of YHWH your God for any vow” (Deuteronomy 23:19).

The Talmud explains the two sides of the question: Is it that God states in the Torah: “When you shall vow a vow to YHWH your God, you shall not delay paying it” (Deuteronomy 23:22), and this one, the heir, did not make a vow? Or perhaps the essence of the mitzva is as it says: “And there you shall come; and there you shall bring your burnt-offerings and your sacrifices” (Deuteronomy 12:5–6), and this one, the heir, is obligated to come and bring his father’s offerings."

One Sage,  R' Elazar, holds that “at your own pleasure [kenafshekha], ” which literally means: In accordance with your soul, is referring to a matter for which he hands over his soul,  i.e., the laborer acquires the fruit by virtue of the risks he accepts upon himself as part of his work."

The verse states: “And he writes her, ” in any case,  i.e., a bill of divorce can be written on any type of surface. If so, what is the meaning when the verse states “scroll”?  This teaches: Just as a scroll is neither alive nor food, so too,  a bill of divorce may be written on any object that is neither alive nor food.  This is why R' Yosei HaGelili deems invalid a bill of divorce written on a living being."

It is stated in the verse that deals with divorce: “And he writes for her a scroll of severance and gives it in her hand” (Deuteronomy 24:1). This teaches the following: If God had written only: And he gives a scroll of severance in her hand, I would say that the verse serves to exclude this case of the first clause of the Mishnah, where it was done not for the sake of severance,  as the scribe wrote the bill of divorce as a mere exercise; however,  if one wrote a bill of divorce to divorce his wife but then reconsidered, where it was done for the sake of severance,  I would say that it is valid for another man to use for divorcing his wife. Therefore, God writes in the Torah: “And he writes, ” meaning that the bill of divorce must be written exclusively for the sake of his own divorce."

R' Zeira said to R' Abbahu, and some say it was Reish Lakish who said this to R' Yoḥanan:  Is this other proof, taught by R' Yehuda HaNasi, unacceptable:  “When a man takes a woman and has sex with her” (Deuteronomy 24:1)?

And Reish Lakish screamed at them like a crane:  Doesn’t the verse state: “And she departs out of his house and goes and becomes another man’s wife” (Deuteronomy 24:2), juxtaposing the halakhot of divorce and betrothal? But no one paid any attention to him.  R' Asi said to him:  Is R' Avin reliable?  Can one be sure that he transmitted an accurate report? R' Zeira said to him: Yes,  in this case he can be trusted, since the elapsed time was only like the interval between catching a fish from the sea and bringing it to a frying pan [tignei]. "

As it is stated with regard to a woman who was divorced and married another man who subsequently died or divorced her: “Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife” (Deuteronomy 24:4). R' Akiva emphasizes the words “who sent her away,” implying that he may not remarry her after sending her away.  This indicates that there is an instance where a husband may not remarry his wife even if she has not married another, merely because he has given her a bill of divorce. This applies to the case of a yevama where the bill of divorce she receives renders her permanently prohibited to him. According to R' Akiva, once she is rendered prohibited to him, no further action performed by the yavam is effective, so why does the levirate betrothal performed require a bill of divorce?"

On this topic, it was stated:  With regard to one who plucks one of two white hairs, everyone agrees that he is liable because a single hair remains, which is less than the measure that determines impurity, i.e., two hairs. It is with regard to one who plucks one of three white hairs that there is a dispute between the amora’im. Rav Naḥman said:  He is liable. Rav Sheshet said:  He is exempt.  The Talmud elaborates. Rav Naḥman said:  He is liable because his actions were effective, as if another hair is removed,  the impurity would cease.

One might have thought that this applies even if the one owed the money establishes it as a loan for the one who owes the money after he was already liable for such payment. Therefore, the verse states: “Any manner of loan” (Deuteronomy 24:10), which demonstrates that once the debt has been converted into a loan, it is like any other loan, and therefore one may not take collateral against the debtor’s will."

Isn’t this verse necessary to teach that which God states: You shall not mete out two punishments to him;  i.e., do not take money from him as ransom and also kill him?  The Talmud answers: That halakha is derived from the verse: “Then it shall be, if the guilty deserves to be lashed, that the judge shall lie him down and flog him before him, according to the measure of his evildoing” (Deuteronomy 25:2). From the fact that “evildoing” is singular, the Talmud homiletically infers: For one evildoing, you can render him liable, but you cannot render him liable for two evildoings,  i.e., one cannot receive two punishments for the same act."

If we say that it is the verse “And one who smites an animal shall pay for it, and one who smites a person shall die” (Leviticus 24:21), clearly that is not so, as that is written with regard to death.  Smiting a person in that verse is referring to murder. Rather,  it is to this term smites that Rava is referring: “And he who smites an animal shall pay for it, a life for a life” (Leviticus 24:18), and juxtaposed to it,  it is written: “And a man who places a blemish upon his counterpart, as he has done so shall be done to him” (Leviticus 24:19).

R' Abba bar Memel objects to this: If so,  the inclusion of those liable to be executed with court-imposed death penalties should also be learned by means of a verbal analogy: “If from the eyes of [me’einei] the assembly it was performed unwittingly” (Numbers 15:24) stated with regard to idol worship, for which one is liable to be executed, from: “Before your eyes, ” stated with regard to lashes. On that basis, one should derive that those liable to be executed with a court-imposed death penalty should also be flogged."

Consequently, the concern with regard to the Samaritans is that their descendants include the children of a widow who unlawfully wed one who was not her brother-in-law."

Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: The verse states “If brothers dwell together and one of them dies” (Deuteronomy 25:5), meaning that they had a common dwelling together in the world.  This excludes the wife of a brother with whom he did not coexist.  Furthermore, it is derived: “Together” means that they were united together in an inheritance;  i.e., they are united in that they inherit together. In other words, since property is inherited by sons from their father, it can be inferred that the verse is speaking specifically of brothers from the same father.

Therefore, the Mishnah teaches us that she is considered to be his wife to the extent that the relationship can be severed with a bill of divorce alone."

Since the prohibition against engaging in sex with one’s brother’s wife is overridden only for the sake of fulfilling the mitzva of consummating the levirate marriage, when one does not have the intention to fulfill that mitzva, the baseline prohibition applies, and so any offspring from the union will be mamzerim. The Rabbis say:  The Torah states: “Her brother-in-law will have sex with her” (Deuteronomy 25:5), which indicates that he should do so in any case,  even if his intentions are not solely for the sake of fulfilling the mitzva."

But a woman, whether she is an adult or a minor,  can be released by ḥalitza, as the verse does not indicate her age. To counter this, Rav Naḥman teaches us that a woman is juxtaposed to a man in this passage, indicating that the yevama must also have reached adulthood, and the halakha is not in accordance with the opinion of R' Yosei.

          "talmudFullText": "Rav Asi, and some say it was Rav Avira, strongly objects to that conclusion: However, if that is so,  that from the term: His house, in the singular, one derives one wife and not two, then two widows of a brother who died without a child [yevamot] who come from one house,  i.e., they were married to the same man, should not be obligated to marry his brother in levirate marriage.  In addressing levirate marriage, the Torah says: “So shall it be done to the man that does not build his brother’s house” (Deuteronomy 25:9). One may derive from this: One house, i.e., wife, and not two. The Talmud responds that when the Torah says: “Then his yevama shall go up to the gate” (Deuteronomy 25:7), “and his yevama will draw nigh to him” (Deuteronomy 25:9), twice, it comes to include a situation where the deceased had two wives; in that case one of them is required to marry his brother in levirate marriage."

As we learned in a Mishnah (Yevamot 106b): The mitzva of ḥalitza is performed in this manner: The yavam and his yevama come before the court,  and the judges of the court offer him advice that is appropriate for him as to whether to enter levirate marriage or to perform ḥalitza, as it is stated: “And the elders of his city shall call him and speak to him” (Deuteronomy 25:8)."

Since the minimum number of the plural term “Elders” is two, and since, in order to prevent a paralyzing disagreement between an even number of judges, a court may not be composed of an even number of judges, one more is added to them. Therefore, there are three judges. And R' Yehuda interprets the verse otherwise, for one verse states: “And the Elders of his city shall call him” (Deuteronomy 25:8), indicating a minimum of two judges, and it says in the following verse “Elders” another time, indicating an additional two people, and since a court may not be composed of an even number of judges, one more is added to them.

The Talmud explains: The verse states with regard to the indemnity of humiliation: “When men strive together, a man and his brother” (Deuteronomy 25:11). The formulation “and his brother” teaches that the payment of compensation for humiliation is applicable with regard to someone who has a relationship of brotherhood with a Jew.

The Talmud answers: As it is written: “And you were faint and weary” (Deuteronomy 25:18). The term faint is referring to the thirst of the Israelites in the desert. And,  in the standard Aramaic translation, we translate the verse as: And you were thirsty [meshalhei] and weary.  The letters ḥet and heh are sometimes interchanged, and therefore the term beit hashelaḥin connotes a thirsty field."

The Talmud answers: It should not enter your mind to say this, as it was taught in a baraita: The verse states: “Remember what Amalek did to you” (Deuteronomy 25:17). One might have thought that it suffices for one to remember this silently, in his heart.  But this cannot be, since when it says subsequently: “You shall not forget” (Deuteronomy 25:19), it is already referring to forgetting from the heart. How,  then, do I uphold the meaning of “remember”?  What does this command to remember add to the command to not forget? Therefore, it means that the remembrance must be expressed out loud, with the mouth. "

These gifts must be given and not sold or bartered. Therefore, since exchange is a form of buying and selling,  it is an inappropriate mode of acquisition with regard to tithes. By contrast, transferring ownership of movable property by means of transferring ownership of land is a powerful form of giving.  Consequently, Rabban Gamliel could not give them the tithes by means of a symbolic exchange using a cloth, but instead had to give it to them along with land. Therefore, since the transaction was not effected by means of a courtyard, it poses no difficulty to Ulla’s opinion."

Abaye said: It stands to reason in accordance with the opinion of Rav, as it was taught in a Tosefta: In the confession of the tithes, one recites, “I did not transgress your mitzvot and I did not forget” (Deuteronomy 26:13). The meaning of phrase, I did not transgress,  is that I did not refrain from blessing You when separating tithes; and the meaning of the phrase, and I did not forget,  is that I did not forget to mention Your name in the blessing recited over it. However, this baraita did not teach that one must mention God’s sovereignty in the blessing."

The Talmud explains: Torah is indeed called a matter that rejoices the heart,  but it is not called “goodness. ”"

And the word covenant is used with regard to afflictions, as it is written: “These are the words of the covenant” (Deuteronomy 28:69). Just as,  in the covenant mentioned with regard to salt, the salt sweetens the taste of the meat and renders it edible, so too in the covenant mentioned with regard to suffering, the suffering cleanses a person’s transgressions,  purifying him for a more sublime existence."

A cup of blessing over which to recite a blessing and he does not recite a blessing, as it is written: “I will bless them that bless you” (Genesis 12:3); one who blesses is blessed and one who does not bless does not merit a blessing. And with regard to one who conducts himself with an air of superiority, as R' Ḥama ben Ḥanina, said: Why did Joseph die before his brothers,  as evidenced by the order in the verse: “And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation” (Exodus 1:6)? Because he conducted himself with an air of superiority,  and those who did not serve in a leadership role lived on after he died."

It is like a fox walking along a riverbank when he sees fish gathering and fleeing from place to place.  The fox said to them: From what are you fleeing?  They said to him:  We are fleeing from the nets that people cast upon us.  He said to them: Do you wish to come up onto dry land, and we will reside together just as my ancestors resided with your ancestors?  The fish said to him: You are the one of whom they say, he is the cleverest of animals? You are not clever; you are a fool. If we are afraid in the water, our natural habitat which gives us life,  then in a habitat that causes our death, all the more so.  The moral is: So too, we Jews, now that we sit and engage in Torah study, about which it is written: “For that is your life, and the length of your days” (Deuteronomy 30:20), we fear the empire to this extent; if we proceed to sit idle from its study, as its abandonment is the habitat that causes our death, all the more so will we fear the empire."

As, if it enters your mind that one should read: “That they may learn, ” as it is written, and you will explain that since he is not able to speak he is not able to learn,  and similarly the reason for the exemption of a deaf person is that since he is not able to hear he is not able to learn,  you will have erred.

R' Abbahu said:  The source of the mitzva of zimmun is derived from the verse here: “When I call the Name of YHWH, give [plural] praise to our God” (Deuteronomy 32:3)."

The Talmud asks: And say that scholars come from the tribe of Judah also, as it is written: “Judah is my lawgiver” (Psalms 60:9). Rava answers: While it is true that the tribe of Judah also taught Torah, in my statement I was speaking only of those who can draw conclusions according to the halakha.  Although Judah produces great scholars, men capable of translating abstract analysis of the Torah into legal principles come from the two tribes mentioned."

And God was saying: “Who will rise up for Me against the evildoers? Who will stand up for Me against the workers of iniquity? ” (Psalms 94:16). In other words, God asked: Who will now defend the Jewish people against its accusers? The idea that God Himself transported Moses to his burial could not have been said if not for the proof from the resolution between the contradictory verses."
