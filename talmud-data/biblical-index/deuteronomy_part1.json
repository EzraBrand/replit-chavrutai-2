The school of R' Yannai said: Moses said before God: God!, because of the gold and silver that You lavished upon the Jewish people during the exodus from Egypt until they said enough [dai],  this wealth caused the Jewish people to fashion for themselves gods of gold.  The combination of wealth and leisure left them open to a transgression of that sort. There is a parable for this: A lion does not maul and roar over a basket of straw from which he derives no pleasure; rather,  he mauls and roars over a basket of meat,  as he roars only when satiated. In other words, the guilt is not exclusively theirs."

If we say it is with regard to the need to study it carefully and to decide the case justly, it is obvious that even cases relating to small sums must be judged thoroughly. Rather,  Reish Lakish was speaking with regard to giving it precedence:  The small claims case may not be deferred in favor of the larger claim merely because the disputed sum is smaller."

There is an apparent contradiction between these verses, as one indicates God commanded the judges and the other indicates He commanded the people. R' Elazar says that R' Simlai says:  Moses issued a warning to the community that the awe of the judge must be upon them, and Moses issued a warning to the judge that he must bear the burden of the community. Up to what degree must the judge bear this burden? R' Ḥanan, and some say R' Shabbtai, says:  It is as Moses said, that he carried Israel “as a nursing father carries the sucking child” (Numbers 11:12)."

By juxtaposing food and water, the verse teaches that food is like water: Just as Moses wished to purchase water that was unchanged, so too,  he wished to purchase food that was unchanged,  i.e., uncooked. Evidently, this is because foods cooked by non-Jews are prohibited."

How is this derived? The only meaning of the term “his tent” is his wife, as is stated after the giving of the Torah: “Go say to them, return again to your tents” (Deuteronomy 5:27).

And it was repeated at Sinai,  in the verse: “Go say to them: Return to your tents” (Deuteronomy 5:27), when the Jewish men were commanded to resume sex with their wives after having been commanded to separate from them in preparation for the giving of the Torah. Nevertheless, the mitzva of procreation was stated for the Jewish people and not for the descendants of Noah. "

He reasoned an a fortiori inference by himself and said: If Israel, with whom the Shekhina spoke only one time and God set a specific time for them when the Shekhina would be revealed, and yet the Torah stated: “Prepare yourselves for three days, do not approach a woman” (Exodus 19:15); I, with whom the Shekhina speaks all the time and God does not set a specific time for me, all the more so that I must separate from my wife. And from where do we derive that God agreed with him? As it is written after the revelation at Sinai: “Go say to them: Return to your tents” (Deuteronomy 5:26), meaning to your homes and wives. And afterward it is written that God told Moses: “And you, stand here with Me” (Deuteronomy 5:27), indicating that Moses was not allowed to return home, as he must constantly be prepared to receive the word of God. And some say a different source indicating that God agreed with his reasoning. When Aaron and Miriam criticized Moses’ separation from his wife, God said: “With him do I speak mouth to mouth,  even manifestly, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of YHWH does he behold; why then were you not afraid to speak against My servant, against Moses? ” (Numbers 12:8). This indicates that God agreed with his reasoning."

The word totafot is written once in plene form, i.e., with a vav, indicating the plural form, and twice in a deficient form, i.e., without a vav, indicating the singular. Accordingly, there are four frontlets here,  and from here the rabbis derive that the tefillin of the head consist of four compartments, which together form a cube. Why not say that the vocalized text,  read in the plural, is effective,  i.e., that it requires six compartments, and likewise, the consonantal text,  read in the singular, is effective,  i.e., it requires four compartments, and therefore one should be required to prepare five compartments for the tefillin of the head?"

If the debtor pays his debt, he can reclaim his property at any point.

Therefore, once the debtor repays his debt to the creditor, legal formalism should not prevent return of the debtor’s property."

It is derived from a verse, as it is stated: “And you shall consume all the peoples that YHWH your God shall deliver unto you” (Deuteronomy 7:16), indicating that it is permitted to consume the other nations’ property only when they are delivered into your hand,  i.e., in times of war, but not when they are not delivered into your hand.

When do they disagree? With regard to the term hamotzi, as the Rabbis hold that hamotzi means that God brought forth,  in the past tense, as it is written: “Who brought forth [hamotzi] for you water from a rock of flint” (Deuteronomy 8:15), which depicts a past event. R' Neḥemya holds that the term hamotzi means that God brings forth in the present tense, as it is stated in Moses’ prophecy to the Jewish people in Egypt: “And you will know that I am YHWH your God who is bringing you forth [hamotzi] from under the burdens of Egypt” (Exodus 6:7). Since, in that context, hamotzi is used with regard to an event transpiring in the present or possibly even one that will transpire in the future, it is inappropriate to include this term in a blessing referencing the past."

R' Ami and R' Asi disagreed on the matter. One said: There is no comparison between one who has bread in his basket and one who does not have bread in his basket.  The affliction in eating the manna lay in there being no leftover food for the next day. Each day the people worried that they might not have any food to eat the next day. And one said: There is no comparison between one who sees the food and eats it and one who does not see the food and eats it. Though the manna could taste like anything, it always looked the same and did not look as it tasted. Being unable to see the food that they tasted was an affliction."

Isn’t it only for the sake of Israel,  so that you may serve as an emissary, that I granted you prominence; and now that Israel has sinned, why do I need you?  There is no need for an emissary. Immediately, Moses’ strength waned and he was powerless to speak in defense of Israel.

In this case, it says: “That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children” (Deuteronomy 11:21), and the preceding verse says: “And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house, and upon your gates” (Deuteronomy 11:20).

          "talmudFullText": "Rav Hamnuna raises an objection from a baraita that interprets the phrase in the verse “to divert you from the way on which YHWH your God commanded you to walk. ” “To walk”; this is a reference to a positive mitzva. “On which”; this is a reference to a prohibition. And if it enters your mind that the verse is stated with regard to idol worship, how can you find a positive mitzva relating to idol worship?  The Talmud answers: Rav Ḥisda interpreted that the positive mitzva referred to in the verse is: “And you shall smash their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their asherim in fire; and you shall hew down the graven images of their gods; and you shall destroy their name from that place” (Deuteronomy 12:3). A prophet is liable to receive the death penalty if he abolishes this mitzva."

The punishment is as it is written:  “Any man…that offers up a burnt offering or sacrifice, and will not bring it to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting,  to sacrifice it to YHWH, and that man shall be cut off from his people” (Leviticus 17:8–9). The prohibition is as it is written: “Take heed to yourself lest you offer up your burnt offerings in every place that you see” (Deuteronomy 12:13).

Therefore, it is prohibited to eat a non-sacred animal slaughtered in the Temple courtyard even after the fact."

The verse states: “You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind” (Leviticus 19:14). Causing another person to sin is like placing a stumbling block before a blind person; one who does so violates this prohibition. The prohibition of giving a limb from a living animal to a non-Jew is apparently due only to the prohibition of placing a stumbling block. However, it is permitted for one to throw it to dogs.  Therefore, despite the fact that the verse says: “You shall not eat it,” apparently there is no prohibition against benefiting from this prohibited item. This challenges R' Abbahu’s principle."

As the school of R' Yishmael taught:  The verse states: “Only your sacred items which you have, and your vows,  you shall take, and go to the place which YHWH shall choose” (Deuteronomy 12:26). “Only your sacred items”; these are the substitutes. “Which you have”; these are the offspring.  When it states: “And your vows, ” the verse thereby juxtaposes animal substitutes and offspring with an animal consecrated by a vow,  teaching that just as an animal consecrated by a vow is not sacrificed if it is blemished, so too, these are also not sacrificed if they are blemished.  Accordingly, Deuteronomy 17:1 must be understood as referring to a private altar of an individual, as maintained by R' Elazar."

Therefore, the verse states: “Only” (Deuteronomy 12:26). The Talmud asks: Why do I need a verse for this halakha? After all, this halakha is learned as a tradition that the offspring of a sin-offering goes to its death.  The Talmud answers: So too,  this is correct as far as the offspring of a sin-offering is concerned, and the verse comes to teach that this halakha applies to a guilt-offering as well."

The verse therefore teaches us that if he sacrifices the offspring or substitute of a guilt-offering, he transgresses a positive mitzva by it,  as derived from the verse: “Only your sacred things which you have, and your vows, you shall take and go to the place which YHWH shall choose” (Deuteronomy 12:26)."

Rav Kahana teaches this last halakha citing a different verse concerning the enticer: “But you shall kill him [harog tahargennu]” (Deuteronomy 13:10).

The Talmud answers: The verse states: “And you shall gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the open space of the city, and shall burn with fire both the city and the entire plunder taken in it” (Deuteronomy 13:17).

It is derived from this verse that it is prohibited to destroy a sacred item such as a mezuza. Therefore, in a city that has even one mezuza, it is impossible to fulfill the halakhot of an idolatrous city, as not all of its contents may be burned.

Consequently, one might have thought it is prohibited to cook in milk the meat of a bird, which is subject to this prohibition. Therefore, the verse states: “In its mother’s milk,” to exclude a bird, which has no mother’s milk. The Talmud asks: What difference is there between the opinion of R' Yosei HaGelili,  who excludes a bird from the prohibition of meat and milk due to the phrase “in its mother’s milk,” and the opinion of R' Akiva,  who comes to the same conclusion as R' Yosei HaGelili based upon the phrase “You shall not cook a kid”?"

Therefore, the verse states: “And you shall eat before YHWH your God,  in the place which He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, the tithe of your grain, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock” (Deuteronomy 14:23). R' Akiva derives from here that only from the place that you bring up the tithe of grain to Jerusalem, i.e., from Eretz Yisrael, may you bring up a firstborn to the Temple as an offering."

With regard to the emphasis of “all,” these are Shabbatot and Festivals. With regard to what halakha was this stated? If we say it was stated in regard to the issue of tithing and eating on Shabbat, this halakha is redundant. Was a verse necessary to permit the prohibition against moving objects, which applies by rabbinic law? Since the prohibition against moving objects is from the rabbis, the Torah is certainly not referring to this halakha."

As Reish Lakish said: From where do we derive that drinking is included in the concept of eating? As it is stated: “And you shall eat before YHWH your God,  in the place where He shall choose to cause His name to dwell there, the tithe of your grain,  of your wine [tirosh], and of your oil” (Deuteronomy 14:23).

When the verse states: “And you shall bestow the money on all that your heart desires” (Deuteronomy 14:26), it has amplified.  When it then states: “On oxen, on sheep, on wine, and on strong drink, ” it has restricted its discussion to certain specific items. When it concludes with the phrase: “On whatever your soul requests, ” it has once again amplified.  According to this exegetical approach, we conclude that since it amplified and restricted and once again amplified, it has amplified the general category to include everything. What has it amplified the category to include? It has amplified the category to include everything. And what has it restricted from inclusion in the category? Only one thing: According to R' Eliezer, it restricted brine from inclusion because brine is not at all similar to the items listed in the verse; according to R' Yehuda ben Gadish, it restricted water and salt.

Although the hide cannot be eaten, it may be bought together with the ox, and it does not acquire the sanctity of the second tithe. “On sheep” teaches that one may buy a sheep and include in its price payment for its fleece,  which is used for purposes other than eating. “On wine” teaches that one may buy wine and include in its price payment for its jug. “On strong drink” teaches that one is permitted to buy not only actual wine, but one may buy even mead,  water in which grape seeds are soaked, once it has fermented and acquired the flavor of wine."

A baraita states in a baraita with regard to the double expression in the Torah: “You shall open your hand to him [ha’avet ta’avitenu]” (Deuteronomy 15:8). “Ha’avet”; this is referring to one who does not have funds and does not want to be supported by charity. The policy is that the charities provide him funds as a loan and go back and give the funds to him as a gift. “Ta’avitenu”; this is referring to one who has means and does not want to support himself. The policy is that the charities provide money as a gift, and then they go back and collect from his estate after his death.  This is the statement of R' Yehuda. "

He may clear space in this manner provided that he does not move the plucked hair from its place;  it must remain intermingled with the rest of the hair so it will appear that he did not shear the animal. And likewise, one plucks the hair to enable one of the rabbis to examine the place of a blemish and thereby determine whether it is permitted to slaughter the firstborn outside the Temple."

I have derived only that a firstborn ox may not be used for labor and that a firstborn sheep may not be used for shearing. From where is it derived to apply what is said about that animal to this one, and what is said about this animal to that one? The verse states: “You shall do no work…and you shall not shear. ” The term “and” indicates the two parts of the verse apply to both animals.

And when they actually left, they left only during the day, as it is stated:  “On the fifteenth of the first month, on the day after the offering of the Paschal lamb, the children of Israel went out with a high hand before the eyes of Egypt” (Numbers 33:3), indicating that they actually went out during the day."

According to R' Yosei HaGelili, this phrase means: One can fulfill his obligation to eat matza only with food that may be eaten in a state of acute mourning.  This requirement excludes this matza, i.e., the loaves of the thanks-offering and the nazirite wafers, which is not eaten in a state of acute mourning but in a state of joy,  as an acute mourner is prohibited from eating sacrificial foods."

How can these texts be reconciled? R' Shimon ben Elazar explains that there is matza that you are unable to eat for all seven days of Passover, due to the prohibition of harvesting and eating from the new crop of grain that ripened before Passover until after the omer offering. But you are able to eat that same matza for six days, although it is from the new crop, as it is permitted after the bringing of the omer offering on the second day of Passover. This resolution of the verses is possible only if the omer offering is brought on the sixteenth of Nisan, not on any other date."

The rebellious elder transgresses by violating the mitzva: “And you shall do according to the word that they will tell you” (Deuteronomy 17:10), and with regard to the false prophet the verse states: “Who shall speak a word presumptuously in My name” (Deuteronomy 18:20).

The Talmud asks: From where do we derive that in a situation where there is a dispute the new king requires anointing, and the current king cannot simply grant the kingship as an inheritance to whomever he desires? Rav Pappa said that the verse states:  “He and his children in the midst of Israel” (Deuteronomy 17:20). At a time when there is peace in Israel the monarchy transfers smoothly to the king’s son, but not when there is a dispute."
