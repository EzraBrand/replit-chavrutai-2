Since a hornet creeps along the ground, all of the previously mentioned prohibitions with regard to an ant apply to it as well. An additional prohibition is stated in the following verse: “And all flying insects are impure to you; they shall not be eaten” (Deuteronomy 14:19). Based on this precedent, it is possible to say that the addition of the phrase “It shall not be eaten” with regard to impure meat indicates merely an additional negative mitzva for which one would be punished; however, it does not necessarily indicate a prohibition to derive benefit. Rav Ashi <b>said to him: Anywhere that it is possible to expound</b> a new <i>halakha</i>, <b>we expound, and we do not establish</b> the verse as containing <b>additional negative</b> mitzvot with regard to that same prohibition."

His children are mentioned in the verse in order to teach them: The kingdom <b>is an inheritance for you. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>And from where do we</b> derive <b>that when there is a dispute</b> with regard to succession, the king <b>requires anointing, and</b> it is <b>not</b> that <b>whenever the king wishes</b> he can <b>bequeath the kingdom to his son</b> without anointing him? <b>Rav Pappa said</b> that <b>the verse states: “He and his sons, in the midst of Israel. ” When there is peace in Israel we read concerning him: “He and his sons, ” even without anointing; </b> but when there is dispute, anointing is required."
