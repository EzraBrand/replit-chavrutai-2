This pertains to the group of cynics, as it is written: “He withdrew His hand with cynics” (Hosea 7:5), indicating that God distanced Himself from them. This pertains to the group of liars, as it is written: “He that speaks falsehoods shall not be established before My eyes” (Psalms 101:7). This pertains to the group of flatterers, as it is written: “That a flatterer shall not come before Him” (Job 13:16). This pertains to the group of slanderers, as it is stated: “For You are not a God who desires wickedness; evil shall not dwell with You” (Psalms 5:5), which means: You are righteous, and there will be no form of evil in Your dwelling.

What is the meaning of the expression: “According to their own understanding [kitvunam], idols”?  The word kitvunam is interpreted as meaning: According to their image [ketavnitam], and the verse teaches that each and every person would make an image of his god and place it in his pocket. When he would remember it, he would remove it from his bosom and embrace it and kiss it. "

But it also states: “Return, O backsliding children, says YHWH, for I am a lord to you, and I will take you one from a city, and two from a family” (Jeremiah 3:14), implying that repentance is available only to certain individuals. He resolved the contradiction and explained that this is not difficult: Here,  it is referring to repentance out of love or fear,  which few people achieve; there,  it referring is repentance through suffering,  as everyone has thoughts of repentance when they suffer. R' Levi said: Great is repentance, as it reaches the heavenly throne, as it is stated: “Return, Israel, to YHWH your God” (Hosea 14:2). This implies that repentance literally reaches to God."

Yet the prophet calls it stumbling,  implying that one who repents is considered as though he only stumbled accidentally in his transgression. The Talmud asks: Is that so? Didn’t Reish Lakish himself say: Great is repentance, as one’s intentional sins are counted for him as merits, as it is stated: “And when the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does that which is lawful and right, he shall live thereby” (Ezekiel 33:19), and all his deeds, even his transgressions, will become praiseworthy?
