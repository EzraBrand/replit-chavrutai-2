However,  with regard to his father, since the Master said with regard to the verse “by their families, by their fathers’ house” (Numbers 1:2) that one’s family ancestry follows his father, you might say: Let him become impure to bury him.

From the language of the verse, it is derived that the Tabernacle,  i.e., the curtains alone, is called Tabernacle, and the beams are not called Tabernacle,  because they merely facilitate the Tabernacle. The Talmud rejects this: But if that is so,  based on an analysis of the language of the verse, it says there: “And you shall make a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red and a covering of teḥashim above” (Exodus 26:14), then in that case, too,  say that the covering is not considered a tent.  If so, however,  what of the dilemma raised by R' Elazar:  With regard to the hide of a non-kosher animal over a corpse, what is the ruling? Can it become ritually impure as a tent over a corpse?  If the covering of the Tabernacle is not considered a tent, now, the hide of a kosher animal that covered the Tabernacle cannot become ritually impure.  If that is so, is it necessary to mention that the hide of a non-kosher animal cannot become ritually impure? The Talmud answers: The cases are not comparable because it is different there,  in the case of the covering of animal hides, because the verse subsequently restored its status as a tent by uniting the tent and its covering, as it is written: “They shall bear the curtains of the Tabernacle, and the Tent of Meeting, its covering, and the covering of taḥash that is upon it” (Numbers 4:25).

Therefore, the verse states:  “Both male and female shall you send out, outside the camp shall you send them out, and they shall defile not their camps in the midst of which I dwell” (Numbers 5:3).

And according to both the opinion of R' Meir and the opinion of R' Yehuda, the reason why a woman is included is that the verse explicitly includes a woman,  either by adding a conjunction or by repetition of the verb. The Talmud asks: Should one infer that if the verse did not include a woman, I would say that when a woman performs an act of substitution she is not flogged? But didn’t Rav Yehuda say that Rav says, and so too the school of R' Yishmael taught,  that when the verse states: “When a man or woman shall commit any sin that people commit” (Numbers 5:6), the verse equates a woman with a man with regard to all punishments of the Torah?  Why, then, is there a need for the verse to include women in the prohibition against substitution?"

Rather,  it must be that the verse is speaking of robbery of a convert who never married or had children as a Jew, and in any case is no longer legally related to his non-Jew family; he has no heirs.

In this case, he will not be able to keep the payment for himself."

Although she committed adultery, the water evaluates her fidelity only when there is no possibility of proving her guilt in court. What is the reason for this? It is as the verse states:  “And a man lie with her carnally, and it was hidden from the eyes of her husband, and she was defiled secretly, and there was no witness against her” (Numbers 5:13).

Likewise, the words: “When either man or woman shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite, to consecrate himself” (Numbers 6:2), teach that one vow of naziriteship takes effect where another vow of naziriteship already exists. For example, if one takes a vow by stating: I will be a nazirite today, and then repeats the vow, he must observe two periods of naziriteship. Consequently, since sometimes the word nazirite, in its different forms, appears in order to serve as the source of a particular exposition, the number of times it occurs does not indicate the length of an unspecified term of naziriteship."

Likewise, the words: “When either man or woman shall clearly utter a vow, the vow of a nazirite, to consecrate himself” (Numbers 6:2), teach that one vow of naziriteship takes effect where another vow of naziriteship already exists. For example, if one takes a vow by stating: I will be a nazirite today, and then repeats the vow, he must observe two periods of naziriteship.

Therefore, the verse states: “His head, ” to teach that a nazirite who is a metzora must shave his head with a razor. Being that a nazirite is prohibited only to use a razor, if a metzora could fulfill his obligation to remove his hair using other implements, a nazirite who is a metzora would not be permitted to use a razor.

In other words, he may derive benefit from the other elements prohibited to him during his naziriteship, i.e., from grape products. The Talmud challenges: And is it written: No other element of his naziriteship?

Rav Avira taught, sometimes he said it in the name of R' Ami, and sometimes he said it in the name of R' Asi: The ministering angels said before God: God!, in Your Torah it is written:  “The great, mighty and awesome God who favors no one and takes no bribe” (Deuteronomy 10:17), yet You,  nevertheless, show favor to Israel, as it is written: “YHWH shall show favor to you and give you peace” (Numbers 6:26). He replied to them: And how can I not show favor to Israel, as I wrote for them in the Torah: “And you shall eat and be satisfied, and bless YHWH your God” (Deuteronomy 8:10), meaning that there is no obligation to bless YHWH until one is satiated; yet they are exacting with themselves to recite Grace after Meals even if they have eaten as much as an olive-bulk or an egg-bulk.  Since they go beyond the requirements of the law, they are worthy of favor."

If we say it is as it is written with regard to the offerings brought by the tribal princes: “On the first day” (Numbers 7:12) and “on the 7th day” (Numbers 7:48), this is not a conclusive proof, as perhaps this refers not to the 7th day of the week but to the 7th day of sacrificial offerings.  Perhaps they skipped Shabbat and did not sacrifice offerings connected to the dedication of the Tabernacle on that day. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The verse also states: “On the day of the eleventh day” (Numbers 7:72). The repetition of the word day indicates that just as a day is all one continuous period of time, so too, the eleven days were all one continuous period of time, with no break in the middle, even for Shabbat."

The Torah could have said: He heard the voice speaking to him; however, instead the verse said: He heard the voice speaking unto him, indicating that the voice reached him alone. Moses alone heard God’s voice and all of the Jewish people did not hear it. The Talmud answers: This is not difficult. This case, where everyone heard God’s voice, was at Sinai. That case, where Moses alone heard God’s voice, was at the Tent of Meeting. Or if you wish, say instead an alternative resolution. This is not difficult;  when God addressed Moses by calling to him, everyone heard; that which God subsequently communicated by speaking,  Moses alone heard."

As it is stated that God said to Moses: “Let the children of Israel perform the Pesaḥ at its appointed time” (Numbers 9:2).

The Talmud answers that the verse states: You shall perform,  which applies the halakhot stated with regard to the Paschal lamb sacrificed in Egypt to the Paschal lambs of later generations as well. The Talmud asks: But if so, why do I need the qualifying expression “in it”?  The Talmud explains that this qualification teaches that only a bone in it, a fit Paschal lamb,  may not be broken, but there is no prohibition to break the bone of an unfit Paschal lamb."

And it is written that the Jews ate the meat “for an entire month” (Numbers 11:20). If one adds to the first twenty days an additional three days’ journey, these are twenty-three days. Consequently, the subsequent month of twenty-nine days of eating meat ended on the 22nd of Sivan. "

This teaches that the enemies of the Jewish people,  a euphemism for the Jewish people themselves, were liable to receive the punishment of slaughter due to their demand.

By an a fortiori inference it is derived that Miriam, who suffered the more severe reprimand of the Shekhina,  should be ostracized for fourteen days. Why then, was Miriam ostracized for only seven days?"

How is this so?  It is written (Numbers 12:14): “And YHWH said to Moses: If her father had but spit in her face, should she not hide in shame seven days?  Let her be shut up seven days outside the camp, and after that she shall be brought in again,” and therefore, using an a fortiori inference it can be derived that if the Shekhina reprimanded her, she should hide in shame for fourteen days.  Why was Miriam banished for only seven days? Rather,  it is because it is sufficient for the conclusion that emerged from the a fortiori inference to be like the source of the inference. Consequently, this principle is mandated by the Torah itself."

Perhaps their punishment was due to the sin explained by R' Ḥanina bar Pappa. As R' Ḥanina bar Pappa says: The spies uttered a great statement of blasphemy at that time. As it is written:  “But the men that went up with him said: We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than us [mimmennu]” (Numbers 13:31). Do not read this as “for they are stronger than us [mimmennu]” but rather read it as: For they are stronger than Him [mimmennu].  i.e., stronger than God. They were saying, as it were,  that the owner,  i.e., God, cannot remove His utensils,  the inhabitants of Eretz Yisrael, from there.  If so, one can explain that the spies were punished for their blasphemy rather than for their malicious speech."

Just as there,  concerning valuations, more than sixty years old is comparable to less than twenty years old,  as there is a distinct category of those between the ages of twenty and sixty, so too here, more than sixty years old is comparable to less than twenty years old insofar as those older were not subject to the sentence. Yair, son of Manasseh, who was already older, did not die in the wilderness."

Since the Torah states: “Of the first of your dough you shall set apart” (Numbers 15:20), ḥalla can be separated only from dough.

One, Shammai says: From a kav of dough, one is required to separate ḥalla,  the portion of the dough given to a priest. From any less than that measure there is no obligation to separate ḥalla, as that is not the measure alluded to in the verse: “The first of your dough” (Numbers 15:20), written with regard to the mitzva of separating ḥalla. And Hillel says:  One must separate ḥalla only from two kav. And the Rabbis say:  The halakha is neither in accordance with the statement of this one, who is stringent, nor in accordance with the statement of that one, who is lenient. Rather, one and a half kav is the measure from which one is obligated to separate ḥalla. Once the measures increased and the rabbis recalculated the volume of a kav to be greater, they said that based on the measure of the new kav, five quarters of a kav of flour is the measure from which one is obligated to separate ḥalla. R' Yosei says: Five quarters are exempt;  only from dough the size of five quarters and a bit more is one obligated to separate ḥalla."

It is written: “Then it shall be, if it was performed unwittingly, hidden from the eyes of the congregation” (Numbers 15:24). Apparently,  the reference is even to a minority of the people, as “from the eyes” is written,  indicating: Not all of them, but some of them. And it is written: “As for all the people it was performed unwittingly” (Numbers 15:26), to say that based on the principle: The halakhic status of a majority is like that of the entirety, if the majority of the congregation sinned, then yes,  the court is liable to bring an offering. If the minority sinned, then no,  the court is not liable."

          "talmudFullText": "garments mentioned in the Torah are made from wool and linen. This comes to include the law of ritual fringes;  the obligation of ritual fringes applies only to those materials. The Talmud asks: Why is that derivation necessary? With regard to ritual fringes it is written explicitly: “You shall not wear diverse kinds, wool and linen together” (Deuteronomy 22:11); and juxtaposed to it, it is written: “You shall make for you twisted fringes upon the four corners of your covering, with which you cover yourself” (Deuteronomy 22:12). From the juxtaposition of these two verses it is derived that the mitzva of ritual fringes applies only to garments to which the laws of diverse kinds apply. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak responded that the matter is not so clear, as it could have entered your mind to say in accordance with the statement of Rava. As Rava raised a contradiction:  On the one hand, it is written:  “And that they put with the fringe of each corner a thread of sky blue” (Numbers 15:39); apparently, the threads of the ritual fringes must be of the same type of fabric as the corner of the garment. However,  in Deuteronomy, in the laws of ritual fringes, it is written in juxtaposition to the laws of diverse kinds: Wool and linen together.  The ritual fringes may only be made of those materials. How can that contradiction be resolved? Rather, Rava says: Ritual fringes made of wool and linen exempt the garment and fulfill the obligation of ritual fringes whether the garment is of their own type,  wool or linen, whether it is not of their own type.  Whereas with regard to other types,  a garment of their own type, they exempt;  a garment not of their own type, they do not exempt. It would have entered your mind to explain this in accordance with the approach of Rava.  Therefore, the tanna taught us that the obligation of ritual fringes applies only to wool and linen and not to other materials."

Here too,  in the matter of ritual fringes, say that it comes to include other garments from the phrase: Of your covering, with which you cover yourself.  Rav Ashi answered: That amplification is necessary to include the garment of a blind person in the obligation of ritual fringes. As it was taught in a baraita, with regard to ritual fringes it is stated: “And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that you may look upon it and remember all the mitzvot of YHWH” (Numbers 15:39). The phrase: That you may look, comes to exclude a night garment,  which cannot be seen and is therefore exempt from the mitzva of ritual fringes. The tanna continues: Do you say that the verse comes to exclude a night garment? Or is it only to exclude the garment of a blind person who is also unable to fulfill the verse: That you may look upon it? The tanna explains: When it says in Deuteronomy: Of your covering, with which you cover yourself, the garment of a blind person is mentioned,  as he too covers himself with a covering. If so, then how do I fulfill the exclusion: That you may look upon it?  It comes to exclude a night garment. "

Just as there,  the congregation of spies numbered ten, and all were Jews, so too here,  concerning the sanctification of God, there must be ten, all of them being Jews. "

This is derived from a verse, as A baraita states in a baraita: The verse states that God said to Aaron: “And your brethren also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, you shall bring near with you, that they may accompany you and serve you” (Numbers 18:2). The verse is speaking of the Levites accompanying Aaron in your,  i.e., Aaron’s, service of keeping watch in the Temple, which is the only service performed by both priests and Levites. Since the verse speaks of the watch of the Levites only as an accompaniment to the watch of the priests, the Levites do not keep watch from above like the priests, but only from below."

Rav interprets this verse as follows: “A service of gift” indicates a service that involves giving, i.e., placing something on the altar, and not a service that involves removal from the altar, to the exclusion of removing the ashes. “And you shall serve [va’avadtem]” is interpreted as referring to a service that is complete [avoda tamma] on its own, such as sprinkling the blood, and not a service that is not complete, i.e., a service that is only a preparatory step and has another service after it that completes its purpose, such as slaughtering the animal or collecting its blood, which are only preparatory steps leading up to the sprinkling of the blood on the altar."

This leads to the conclusion that when it comes to services performed outside of the Holy of Holies, a non-priest would be liable if he performed any service, even a service of removal,  such as the removal of ashes from the altar."

Why would one even suspect that a priest should be required to slaughter the offering, so that a specific verse is required to tell us otherwise? From the fact that it is stated: “And you and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood” (Numbers 18:7), I would derive that no part of the sacrificial service may be performed by a non-priest, not even slaughtering.

But here,  with regard to the matter of the Temple service, I will say that the verse states with regard to the gifts to which members of the priesthood are entitled: “As a consecrated portion” (Numbers 18:8), to indicate that they must be eaten in greatness, in the way that the kings eat. And since kings do not generally eat the skin of the tail, I will say that it is not considered an eaten portion of the offering.

Rather, let the verse not state: “It shall not be redeemed, ” with regard to dedications, and instead one can derive the prohibition from the firstborn offering: Just as the firstborn offering is sacred and may not be redeemed,  as the verse states: “You shall not redeem it” (Numbers 18:17), so too, dedications are also sacred and may not be redeemed. Why do I need the phrase “It shall not be redeemed” that God writes in the case of dedications? It is evidently to be considered free to enable the verbal analogy to the animal tithe."

Teruma gedola was not separated from the tithe that was eaten by the Levite.

It is as it is stated: “And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, seeing that you have set apart from it the best thereof” (Numbers 18:32).

The verse states: “Law” (Numbers 19:2), at the beginning of the section on the red heifer, to indicate that the same rules govern all stages of the rite. As such, I might have thought that I should include even the collection of its ashes, and the filling of waters, and the sanctification.  Therefore, the verse states:  “This is the statute of the law” (Numbers 19:2). The word this limits the scope of the requirement that the rite must be performed by a man and during the day from applying to these stages."

It may enter your mind to say: God states with regard to the slaughter of the red heifer: “And you shall give it to Elazar the priest…and he shall slaughter it before him” (Numbers 19:3), from which it is inferred: One may slaughter it, but not it and another animal simultaneously. And what are the circumstances of that prohibition? It is a case where one slaughtered two red heifers at the same time. But in a case where one slaughtered a red heifer together with a non-sacred animal, say no,  that it does not disqualify the red heifer. Therefore, Rava teaches us that even slaughter with a non-sacred animal disqualifies the red heifer."

The term “statute” indicates that if one deviates from any of the details of the service as delineated in the verses, the service is not valid.

Slaughtering an additional heifer would invalidate the rite, since performing any additional labor during the rite of the red heifer disqualifies it.

But on what does he wipe his finger after each sprinkling, since he must not wipe it on the body of the heifer, which might cause hair to stick to his finger, interfering with the sprinkling? Abaye said:  He wipes his finger on the lip of the bowl holding the blood for sprinkling, as it is written: “Atoning bowls [keforei] of gold” (Ezra 1:10). The atoning bowls are so named because the priest wipes his finger on them, and the word keforei indicates cleansing by way of wiping (see Ḥullin 8b)."

The Talmud answers: This amplification cannot be that far-reaching, as, if so,  the verbal analogy of tent, tent, that teaches us to derive the tent over a corpse from the Tabernacle, what purpose does it serve if everything is included?

And why may he do so?

And furthermore,  in that verse, one who sprinkles requires washing of his clothes,  indicating a more severe level of impurity, whereas one who touches does not require washing of his clothes.  Apparently, when it is written: He who sprinkles, it is not referring to one who touches."

When the princes of Moab saw that Balaam was riding on his donkey, they said to him: What is the reason that you do not ride upon a horse,  which is more fitting for you? Balaam said to them:  I am riding on a donkey because I left my horse in a meadow to graze. Immediately: “And the donkey said to Balaam: Am not I your donkey? ” (Numbers 22:30), i.e., the donkey you always use. Balaam said to it: For carrying burdens only,  not for riding."

The Talmud explains: This is derived from the following comparison: It is written here that Balaam’s donkey said: “Was I ever wont [hahasken hiskanti] to do so to you” (Numbers 22:30), and it is written there,  with regard to Abishag the Shunammite and King David: “And be a companion [sokhenet] unto him;  and let her lie in your bosom” (I Kings 1:2).

Rather,  the reason that he will be injured is not based on the verse but rather due to the concept of measure for measure:  Since he attempts to tell his fortune, it injures him."

If we say that it means that one silences him from a claim to his father’s assets and he does not inherit his estate, that is obvious. Do we know who his father is?  It could be any one of the ten. Rather,  it means that one silences him from a claim to the status of priesthood.  Although there is no doubt that his father is a priest, the son is not a priest, as it is written: “And it shall be for him and for his offspring after him an everlasting covenant of priesthood” (Numbers 25:13). From this it is derived: In the case of a priest whose offspring are attributed to him,  his offspring are priests; to the exclusion of this priest, whose offspring are not attributed to him,  and whose offspring are not priests. This child, therefore, is a shetuki only in the sense that he may not perform the Temple service as a priest. However, he is permitted to marry a Jewish woman."

R' Zeira says that Rav says: From where is it derived that this halakha with regard to the gift of a person on his deathbed is by Torah law? As it is stated in the passage delineating the laws of inheritance: “If a man dies, and he does not have a son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass to his daughter” (Numbers 27:8). The term “you shall cause…to pass” is superfluous, as the verse could have stated: His inheritance shall go to his daughter. One can therefore derive from this term that you have another case of causing property to pass to another, which is comparable to this case of inheritance, which does not require an act of acquisition. And what is this case? This is the case of the gift of a person on his deathbed. "

He should do so akin to the way that Hannah spoke in her prayer, as it is stated: “Now Hannah spoke in her heart;  only her lips moved, but her voice could not be heard” (I Samuel 1:13), which indicates she did enunciate the words but spoke so quietly that no one else could hear."

But with regard to these priests, since they are obligated to sound all year long, because they sound trumpets when they offer the sacrifices in the Temple, as it is written: “And you shall sound the trumpets over your burnt-offerings,  and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings” (Numbers 10:10), you might say that they are not obligated to sound the shofar on Rosh HaShana.

And another verse says: “It is a day of blowing for you” (Numbers 29:1), i.e., a day on which one must actually sound the shofar.

In the case of “this is the matter” written with regard to the heads of the tribes,  in the introductory verse to the halakhot of vows: “And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying: This is the matter that YHWH has commanded” (Numbers 30:2), is it also the case that the halakhot of vows will not be practiced except in this generation?  Rav Ashi said to him:  The halakha in that case, that of vows, is derived through a verbal analogy between the word “this” stated here, in the verse discussing vows, and the word “this” stated there,  in the verse discussing offerings slaughtered outside the Tabernacle or Temple, which is applicable in all generations."

A different version relates the discussion as follows: The rabbis initially assumed: What is the meaning of the term meḥitza mentioned in the Mishnah? A division,  not a partition, as it is written: “And the division of [meḥetzat] the congregation was” (Numbers 31:43). According to this interpretation, the Mishnah means to say: Since they wished to divide the jointly owned courtyard, they build a proper wall in the center even against the will of one of the partners.

No Jewish soldiers fell in battle, and therefore the concern for impurity must have been due to the corpses of non-Jews.

R' Abba said: Everyone agrees that when the children of Israel were redeemed from Egypt were given permission to leave, they were redeemed only in the evening, as it is stated:  “In the spring YHWH, your God, took you out from Egypt at night” (Deuteronomy 16:1). And when they actually left, they left only during the day, as it is stated:  “On the fifteenth of the first month, on the day after the offering of the Paschal lamb, the children of Israel went out with a high hand before the eyes of Egypt” (Numbers 33:3), indicating that they actually went out during the day."

From the fact that when the Bible speaks of the month of Av,  which is the 5th month, it calls that year “the fortieth year, ” and when it speaks of the following Shevat, it also calls that year “the fortieth year, ” the implication is that the New Year does not begin in Tishrei.  Were it the case that the New Year begins in Tishrei, Av and the following Shevat would not be in the same year because the year would have changed in Tishrei."

Before the Talmud completes the quote, it analyzes the statement: Why would the court appoint a steward to their disadvantage? Rather,  it means to their disadvantage in order to achieve their eventual benefit.  Once a steward has been appointed to control the orphans’ estate, he has the authority to act to their temporary disadvantage if they are ultimately likely to benefit from the action.

Since this verse mentions both the term border and the term outside, the term border is derived from the term outside. And the term outside is derived from the term outside, as it is written with regard to the Levite cities, which also served as cities of refuge: “And you shall measure from outside [miḥutz] the city on the east side two thousand cubits,  and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits” (Numbers 35:5). From this chain of identical terms, the meaning of the term place stated in connection with Shabbat is derived from the two thousand cubits mentioned with regard to the Levite cities."

I have derived only that the murderer is put to death with the mode of execution stated concerning him,  namely, killing by decapitation. From where do I derive that if you cannot put him to death with the mode of execution written concerning him,  e.g., if he is escaping, that you can put him to death with any mode of execution with which you can put him to death? The verse states:  “He that smote him shall be put to death [mot yumat], ” the doubled verb teaching that he is put to death in any case,  by any mode of execution.

Rav Mesharshiyya said: What is the reason for the opinion of Rav Aḥa, the father of my father, who exempts him from payment? The reason is that the verse states:  “Or in enmity he struck him with his hand and he died, the assailant shall be put to death; he is a murderer” (Numbers 35:21). The phrase “he is a murderer” restricts the liability of one who confines another. It is in the case of a murderer that the Torah renders for us one who confines another liable to be executed.

It is necessary since it is stated:  “And the blood redeemer finds him…and the blood redeemer murders the murderer” (Numbers 35:27). One might have thought that the blood redeemer may murder him immediately;  therefore, the verse states: “Until he stands before the congregation for judgment, ” from which it is derived that the blood redeemer may kill the murderer only after he is convicted in court.

Since the plural term “tribes” includes both her father’s tribe and her mother’s tribe, the verse juxtaposes the tribe of the mother to the tribe of the father,  in that just as with regard to the father’s tribe a father inherits from his son, so too,  with regard to the mother’s tribe, a woman inherits from her son if the father is deceased."

She bequeaths only to her father’s tribe."

This mitzva, that the woman should marry a member of her own tribe, applied only to the first generation that received tribal portions of Eretz Yisrael. And,  by contrast, there were many mitzvot,  e.g., all the mitzvot that applied only from the time that Eretz Yisrael was settled, which the sons were commanded to fulfill but which the fathers were not commanded to fulfill. Because there are mitzvot for the fathers that are not for the sons, and there are mitzvot for the sons that are not for the fathers,  the verse needed to state,  i.e., to address, the fathers,  and it needed to state,  i.e., to address, the sons.

This supports the ruling of R' Ami, as R' Ami says: In the context of sitting in judgment or learning Torah, follow the participants’ wisdom in determining the seating, so that the wisest is granted the highest honor, and in the context of reclining for a meal, follow the participants’ age. Rav Ashi says: And this is so only when one is outstanding in wisdom,  then wisdom trumps age; and this is so only when one of the participants is outstanding in age,  i.e., particularly old, then age trumps wisdom."
