The Talmud responds that <b>the verse said: “And you shall make the beams for the Tabernacle</b> of acacia wood, standing up” (Exodus 26:15). From the language of the verse, it is derived that the <b>Tabernacle, </b> i.e., the curtains alone, is <b>called Tabernacle, and</b> the <b>beams are not called Tabernacle, </b> because they merely facilitate the Tabernacle. The Talmud rejects this: <b>But if that is so, </b> based on an analysis of the language of the verse, it says there: <b>“And you shall make a covering for the tent</b> of rams’ skins dyed red and a covering of <i>teḥashim</i> above” (Exodus 26:14), then in <b>that</b> case, <b>too, </b> say that <b>the covering is not considered a tent. </b> If so, <b>however, </b> what of <b>the dilemma raised by R' Elazar: </b> With regard to <b>the hide of a non-kosher animal</b> over a corpse, <b>what is</b> the ruling? <b>Can</b> it <b>become ritually impure as a tent over a corpse? </b> If the covering of the Tabernacle is not considered a tent, <b>now, the hide of a kosher animal</b> that covered the Tabernacle <b>cannot become ritually impure. </b> If that is so, <b>is it necessary to mention that the hide of a non-kosher animal</b> cannot become ritually impure? The Talmud answers: The cases are not comparable because <b>it is different there, </b> in the case of the covering of animal hides, <b>because the verse subsequently restored</b> its status as a tent by uniting the tent and its covering, <b>as it is written: “They shall bear the curtains of the Tabernacle, and the Tent of Meeting, its covering, and the covering of <i>taḥash</i> that is upon it”</b> (Numbers 4:25). The verse <b>juxtaposes the upper to the lower</b> covering; <b>just as</b> the <b>lower</b> covering <b>is considered a tent, so too, </b> the <b>upper</b> covering <b>is considered a tent. </b>"
