He said to him: You who served Naḥum of Gam Zu for twenty-two years, who would expound and learn that every appearance of the word et in the Torah is meant to teach something, what would he expound from the phrase: “The heaven and the earth” [et hashamayim ve’et ha’aretz] (Genesis 1:1)? He said to him:  These words should be expounded as follows: Had it stated:  In the beginning God created hashamayim veha’aretz, i.e., the heaven and the earth, without the word et, I would have said: Shamayim is the name of God,  and the same goes for aretz, and the verse would sound as if it meant that God, whose name is Shamayim and Aretz, created the world. Since it states “et hashamayim ve’et ha’aretz, ” it is clear that these are created objects and that shamayim means the actual heaven and aretz is the actual earth.  It is for this reason that the word et is necessary."

He arose and found women and men waiting for him. Whom does he praise? Those who are unaccustomed to rising early but yet rose early,  the women. The same applies to the earth: Since it is a lowly, physical sphere, we would not have expected it to be created together with heaven. Therefore, it is fitting to discuss it at greater length."

But here,  in the case under discussion, perhaps prayer is in place of sacrifice.

The Talmud also relates that Rav Ḥisda and Rabba bar Rav Huna would sit in judgment all day and their hearts would grow weak from hunger. Therefore, Rav Ḥiyya bar Rav from Difti taught them a baraita with regard to the verse: “And it was the next day and Moses sat to judge the people and the people stood over Moses from the morning until the evening” (Exodus 18:13). Does it enter your mind that Moses would sit and judge all day long?  If so, when was his Torah study accomplished? Rather,  surely the verse is coming to tell you: Any judge who judges a true judgment truthfully, even if he sits in judgment only one hour, the verse ascribes to him as if he became a partner to God in the act of Creation,  as by means of a true judgment he upholds the world (Me’iri). This conclusion is derived by means of a verbal analogy [gezera shava]: It is written here: “And the people stood over Moses from the morning until the evening. ” And it is written there,  in the act of Creation: “And it was evening and it was morning, one day” (Genesis 1:5). The evening and part of the morning are considered a whole day.

The Talmud asks: What is the reason,  i.e., where is there an allusion to this in the Torah? Rav Adda bar Ahava said in the name of Ulla:  It is derived from a verbal analogy between the term: “According to its species [leminehu]” (Genesis 1:21), referring to animals living on dry land,  and the same term: “According to its species [leminehu]” (Genesis 1:25), referring to sea creatures.

From where is it derived that this is the meaning of built? It is because in the islands of the sea they call braiding building. It was taught in a baraita that R' Shimon ben Elazar says:  With regard to a woman who braids her hair and who applies eye shadow or blush on Shabbat, if she did it for herself, she is exempt;  if she did it for another, she is liable.  This is because a woman cannot perform these actions for herself in as complete a fashion as she can for someone else. And, so too, R' Shimon ben Elazar would say in the name of R' Eliezer: A woman may not apply rouge to her face on Shabbat because by doing so she is dyeing,  which is one of the prohibited labors on Shabbat."

Rav Yehuda says that Rav says, and some determined it to be in the name of R' Yehoshua ben Ḥananya:  It is derived from that which is stated with regard to the punishment of the snake for causing Adam and Eve to sin: “Cursed are you from among all animals, and from among all beasts of the field” (Genesis 3:14), in that your gestation period should be longer than all of them. Now, why does the verse mention the beasts of the field, i.e., undomesticated animals? If the snake was cursed more than the domesticated animals,  then all the more so is it not clear that it was cursed more than the undomesticated animals?  The shortest gestation period of domesticated animals, which is five months for a goat, is longer than the shortest gestation period among undomesticated animals, which is fifty-two days for a cat."

Once daughters were born, the men began to fight among themselves over them. Reish Lakish said to R' Yoḥanan: According to you who say that due to the daughters propagation came to the world, for what reason were the number of Job’s daughters not doubled,  when at the end of the story God doubled everything that Job had lost (see Job 1:3, 42:12)?"

Is the nest considered to be on the ground, such that one is obligated in the mitzva? Rav Mattana said to them that one is obligated in the mitzva in such a case because the verse states: “And earth upon his head” (II Samuel 15:32), rather than: Dirt upon his head, indicating that one’s head is considered like the ground. They also asked Rav Mattana: From where in the Torah is the existence of Moses [Moshe] alluded to before his birth? He replied that the verse states: “For that he also [beshaggam] is flesh;  therefore shall his days be one hundred and twenty years” (Genesis 6:3). The numerical value of beshaggam is the same as that of the Hebrew name Moshe, and it is known that Moses lived a total of 120 years (see Deuteronomy 34:7)."

He is the Satan who seduces people and then accuses them, as it is written: “So the Satan went forth from the presence of YHWH,  and smote Job with vile sores” (Job 2:7). He is also the evil inclination,  as it is written there:  “The impulse of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continuously” (Genesis 6:5); and it is written here: “Only upon himself do not put forth your hand” (Job 1:12). The verbal analogy between the various uses of the word “only” teaches that the evil inclination is to be identified with the Satan. He is also the Angel of Death, as it is written: “Only spare his life” (Job 2:6); apparently Job’s life depends upon him,  the Satan, and accordingly the Satan must also be the Angel of Death."

The Talmud cites proofs for this claim: Corruption refers to a matter of licentiousness, as it is stated: “For all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth” (Genesis 6:12); the word “way” alludes to sex. And corruption also refers to idol worship, as it is written: “Lest you deal corruptly, and make you a graven image” (Deuteronomy 4:16)."

Conversely, there the Flood was for everyone and covered the whole world; whereas here the manna was for the Jewish people alone. And there would be much more manna for them than sixty cubits, which is the measurement put forth by R' Elazar HaModa’i. The Talmud answers: R' Elazar HaModa’i derived “opening” in the verse: “He commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven” (Psalms 78:23), from “opening” in the verse: “And the windows of heaven were opened” (Genesis 7:11).

As R' Abbahu raised a contradiction between the verses: On the one hand it is written: “Male and female, He created them, ” and on the other hand it is written: “For in the image of God He made man” (Genesis 9:6), indicating that man was created alone.

The language of Javan, who is the forbear of the Greek nation and one of the descendants of Japheth, will also serve as a sacred language in the tents of Shem, where Torah is studied."

The Talmud answers: Sarah, Miriam, Deborah, Hannah, Abigail, Huldah, and Esther.  The Talmud offers textual support: Sarah, as it is written:  “Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah” (Genesis 11:29). And R' Yitzḥak said: Iscah is in fact Sarah. And why was she called Iscah? For she saw [sakhta] by means of Holy Spirit, as it is stated: “In all that Sarah has said to you, hearken to her voice” (Genesis 21:12). Alternatively,  Sarah was also called Iscah, for all gazed [sokhin] upon her beauty. "

The Talmud answers: This was not the case, as R' Yoḥanan said with regard to Lot: This entire verse:  “And Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere” (Genesis 13:10), is stated with regard to the sin of licentiousness. Since this verse teaches that Lot was a lustful man, it can therefore be assumed he meant to sin with his daughters as well."

R' Ḥanan says: One who passes the judgment of another to Heaven is punished first, as it is stated: “And Sarai said to Abram: My wrong be upon you,  I gave my handmaid into your bosom; and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes: YHWH judge between me and you” (Genesis 16:5). Sarai stated that God should judge Abram for his actions. And it is written: “And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her” (Genesis 23:2), as Sarah died first. The Talmud comments: And this matter applies only in a situation where he has someone to do judgment for him on earth and has no need to appeal to the heavenly court."

Praying for God to pass judgment on another causes one’s own deeds to be examined and compared with the deeds of the other, as it is stated: “And Sarai said to Abram: My anger be upon you;  I have given my maid into your bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes; let YHWH judge between me and you” (Genesis 16:5), and it is written afterward: “And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her” (Genesis 23:2).

If it was in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis, until noon is also considered morning,  since, according to the rabbis, the daily morning offering could be sacrificed until noon. Apparently, this is an entirely new position."

Abraham requested that God, the Shekhina, wait for him while he tended to his guests appropriately. R' Elazar said: Come and see that the attribute of God is not like that of flesh and blood.

Based on the change, Sarah’s laughter was offensive because she voiced it to others."

The Talmud raises another question: Ultimately, if one deducts Sarah’s days of ritual impurity,  as when the angel spoke Sarah had not yet conceived, and there is a tradition that on that day she began menstruating, as is alluded to in the verse: “After I am grown old, shall I have pleasure” (Genesis 18:12), there are less than seven months."

With regard to a stranger [akhsenai] who comes to the city, one asks him about matters of eating and drinking,  e.g., whether he is hungry or thirsty. Does one ask him:  Is that your wife?  Is that your sister?  Abraham understood from this line of questioning that you are suspect with regard to abducting women, and that is the reason that he introduced Sarah as his sister. Therefore, you are liable to be executed for her abduction."

Why did God request rather than command that Abraham take his son? The Talmud cites a parable of a flesh-and-blood king who confronted many wars. And he had one warrior fighting for him, and he overcame his enemies. Over time,  there was a fierce war confronting him.  The king said to his warrior: I entreat you, stand firm for me in this war,  so that others will not say: There is no substance in the first victories, and you are not a true warrior. Likewise, God also said to Abraham: I have tried you with several ordeals, and you have withstood them all. Now, stand firm in this ordeal for Me, so that others will not say: There is no substance in the first ordeals."

It is written of him that he called the location of the Temple field when he prayed there, as it is stated: “And Isaac went out to meditate in the field” (Genesis 24:63).

How can they possibly outnumber the grains of sand upon the seashore?"

Rebecca’s relatives said to Abraham’s servant that they wanted her to stay for two days,  after which he said to them no,  as he did not want to wait even that long. If so, is it possible that after that they said to him that they wanted her to stay for ten days?  Consequently, it is impossible to explain the word “days” as two days and “ten” as ten days. Rather, what is the meaning of “days”?  It means: A year, as it is written: “For days he shall have redemption” (Leviticus 25:29), and there it is explained that “days” is referring to a year. Consequently, in the verse “And her brother and mother said: Let the damsel abide with us for days, or ten” (Genesis 24:55), “days” refers to a year, and “ten” refers to a shorter period of similar magnitude, i.e. ten months, in order to prepare for her wedding."

From where is it derived that a woman who discharges semen even on the 3rd day after sex is ritually impure,  just like one who touches semen (see Leviticus 15:17)? Because the semen remains fit for insemination, it can transmit impurity, as it is stated prior to the revelation at Sinai: “And he said to the people, prepare yourselves for three days,  do not approach a woman” (Exodus 19:15). This three-day separation period ensured that even a woman who discharged semen would be pure. The Mishnah cites another halakha based on a biblical allusion: From where is it derived that one may wash the circumcision on the 3rd day,  meaning the 3rd day after the circumcision, even if it occurs on Shabbat? As it is stated: “And it came to pass on the 3rd day when they were in pain” (Genesis 34:25). The pain of circumcision lasts at least three days, and as long as the child is in pain he is considered to be in danger. The Mishnah cites another halakha with an allusion in the Bible: From where is it derived that one ties a scarlet strip of wool to the head of the scapegoat that is dispatched to Azazel? As it is stated: “If your sins be like scarlet, they will become white like snow” (Isaiah 1:18). Since the goat is offered to atone for sins, red wool is tied to its horns. The Mishnah cites another allusion. From where is it derived that smearing oil on one’s body is like drinking and is similarly prohibited on Yom Kippur? Although there is no proof for this, there is an allusion to it, as it is stated: “And it comes into his inward parts like water and like oil into his bones” (Psalms 109:18). The verse appears to equate smearing oil on one’s body with drinking water."

The Talmud asks: With regard to that verse that we came to discuss, in any event, what is the significance of the phrase in the verse “And Lotan’s sister was Timna”?  The Talmud explains: Timna was the daughter of kings, as it is written: “The chief of Lotan” (Genesis 36:29), and: “The chief of Timna” (Genesis 36:40), and each chief is a member of a monarchy,  albeit without a crown.  That is why they are called chief and not king."

But Leah advanced ahead of Rachel with appeals for mercy,  i.e., with prayer, and thereby earned the status as firstborn for her firstborn.

If you say it refers to an actual Canaanite, is it possible that Abraham warned Isaac not to marry a Canaanite woman, and Isaac warned Jacob to the same effect, and nonetheless Judah went and married a Canaanite woman? Rather, R' Shimon ben Lakish said:  She was the daughter of a merchant, as it is written: “As for the merchant [kena’an], the balances of deceit are in his hand. He loves to oppress” (Hosea 12:8). And if you wish, say instead that this meaning of the word can be understood from the following verse, which describes Tyre: “Whose traders are princes, whose merchants [kinaneha] are the honorable of the earth” (Isaiah 23:8)."

When Jacob’s sons speak to Joseph, they state: “We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan” (Genesis 42:13), and in the passage discussing inheritance the verse states: “And if he has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers” (Numbers 27:10).

The Talmud rejects this: It is more reasonable to derive from the children of Jacob, due to the fact that the word “brothers” is free in its context and is therefore available to be used in a verbal analogy: Since it could have written: We your servants are twelve children of our father,  but instead it writes:  “Twelve brothers,  the children of one man” (Genesis 42:13), learn from here that this comes to render the word “brothers” free so that it may be allocated to another matter, i.e., the definition of brothers."

Abraham our Patriarch was himself an Elder and would sit in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And Abraham was old, advanced in years” (Genesis 24:1). From the apparent redundancy of the terms old and advanced in years, it is derived that old means that he was a wise Elder and prominent in Torah, and advanced in years means that he was elderly. Similarly, Isaac our Patriarch was an Elder and sat in yeshiva, as it is stated: “And it came to pass when Isaac was old and his eyes were dim” (Genesis 27:1).
