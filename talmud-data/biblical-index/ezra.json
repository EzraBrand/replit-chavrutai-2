Now was Cyrus God’s anointed one, i.e., the Messiah,  that the verse should refer to him in this manner? Rather,  the verse should be understood as God speaking to the Messiah with regard to Cyrus: God said to the Messiah: I am complaining to you about Cyrus,  who is not acting in accordance with what he is intended to do. I had said: “He shall build My House and gather My exiles” (see Isaiah 45:13), but he did not carry this out. Rather, he said: “Whoever is among you of all His people…let him go up to Jerusalem” (Ezra 1:3). He gave permission to return to Israel, but he did no more than that."

Abaye said:  He wipes his finger on the lip of the bowl holding the blood for sprinkling, as it is written: “Atoning bowls [keforei] of gold” (Ezra 1:10).

Rav explains: The brother of the head,  i.e., the brother of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, who is called “head, ” as it is stated: “You are the head of gold” (Daniel 2:38). Of the same character as the head, for he,  Nebuchadnezzar, killed the Jews, and he,  Ahasuerus, sought to kill them. He destroyed the Temple, and he sought to destroy the foundations for the Temple laid by Zerubbabel, as it is stated: “And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote to him an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem” (Ezra 4:6), and he ordered that the construction of the Temple cease."

As it is written: “And I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava; and we encamped there for three days; and I viewed the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi” (Ezra 8:15). With regard to this, Rav Ḥisda said: Initially they would establish officers over the people only from among the Levites, as it states: “And the officers, the Levites, before you” (II Chronicles 19:11), but now they establish officers only from among the Israelites, as it is stated: And the officers of the many at your heads.  This indicates that officers were appointed from: The many, meaning the largest group, ordinary Israelites."

As it is written: “So we fasted and beseeched our God for this” (Ezra 8:23).

The question arises: Does it enter your mind to say: “All this was a burnt-offering”?  Is it possible that a sin-offering is a burnt-offering? Rather,  say: All this was like a burnt-offering. Just as a burnt-offering is not eaten, so too,  this sin-offering is not eaten, as it is taught in a baraita that R' Yehuda says:  It was as atonement for idol worship that they brought them; and Rav Yehuda says that Shmuel says:  It was atonement for the idol worship that they practiced during the days of Zedekiah.

However,  if the poles [kashkushei] and the towers [abrurei] that extend from the house are higher than the synagogue, we have no problem with it. Rav Ashi said: I caused the city of Mata Meḥasseya to not be destroyed by building the synagogue higher than the other houses. The Talmud asks: Wasn’t Mata Meḥasseya ultimately destroyed?
