          "talmudFullText": "R' Ḥama ben Ḥanina, raises a contradiction between the following verses. It is written: “Fury is not in Me” (Isaiah 27:4), and it is written: “YHWH is a jealous and furious God” (Nahum 1:2). The Talmud answers: This is not difficult; here,  where it states that God has no fury, it is speaking with regard to the Jewish people,  whereas there,  where it says that God has fury, it is speaking with regard to the nations of the world. Rav Ḥinnana bar Pappa says in explanation of the verse: “Fury is not in Me; would that I were as the briers and thorns in flame! I would with one step burn it altogether” (Isaiah 27:4). “Fury is not in Me, ” as I have already taken an oath that I will not destroy the Jewish people; “would that I” had not taken this oath,  since then I would be active “as the briers and thorns in flame! I would with one step burn it altogether. ”"

The Talmud answers: They require it for the other interpretation of R' Yehoshua ben Levi, as R' Yehoshua ben Levi said:  This teaches that the dust [avak] from their feet ascended to the throne of glory. It is written here: “As he wrestled [behe’avko] with him, ” and it is written there in a description of how God will punish the wicked: “YHWH, in the whirlwind and in the storm is His way, and the clouds are the dust of His feet” (Nahum 1:3)."

And this is the same as that which Reish Lakish said: What is the meaning of that which is written: “I am God God [El Shaddai]” (Genesis 17:1)? It means: I am He Who said to the world “enough [dai], ” instructing it to stop expanding. Similarly, Reish Lakish said: When God created the sea, it continued to expand until God rebuked it and made it dry, as it is stated: “He rebukes the sea and makes it dry, and desiccates all the rivers” (Nahum 1:4)."

But didn’t Rav Oshaya say: When Solomon built the Temple he planted all sorts of precious golden fruits there, and these brought forth their fruit in their appointed season like other trees, and when the wind blew them the fruit would fall, as it is stated: “May his fruits rustle like Lebanon” (Psalms 72:16). This indicates that fruits grew in Lebanon, which the rabbis interpreted as a reference to the Temple, which was built with cedar trees from Lebanon. And when the non-Jews entered the Sanctuary the golden tree withered, as it stated: “And the blossoms of Lebanon wither” (Nahum 1:4). And God will restore the miraculous trees to Israel in the future, as it is stated: “It shall blossom abundantly, it shall also rejoice and shout, the glory of Lebanon will be given to it” (Isaiah 35:2). Apparently, there were additional miracles in the Temple."

The Talmud answers: This is not difficult; here,  where the verse states that no one can stand before His indignation, it is referring to an individual,  whereas there,  when it is written that God is indignant every day, it is referring to the community,  which can withstand the indignation of God, due to its cumulative merits."

Abaye said:  These are gale force winds. Abaye said: We learned through tradition that there are no gale force winds at night.  The Talmud asks: Don’t we see that there are gale force winds at night? The Talmud answers: This gale force wind that blows at night does not begin blowing at night; rather, it begins blowing during the day. And Abaye said: We learned through tradition that a gale force wind does not last two hours, to fulfill that which is stated: “Trouble shall not rise up a second time” (Nahum 1:9). The Talmud asks: Don’t we see that it does last longer than two hours? The Talmud answers: Actually, it does not last longer than two hours. The fact that we sense that it does last longer is due to cases where it does not blow uninterruptedly, but it briefly stops in between. "

Sometimes he would say it in the name of Rav Ami, and sometimes he would say it in the name of Rav Asi: What is the meaning of that which is written: “Thus says YHWH: Though they be in full strength [shelemim], and likewise many, even so shall they be cut down, and he shall pass away;  and though I have afflicted you, I will afflict you no more” (Nahum 1:12). This means: If a person sees that his sustenance is limited he should use it for charity, and all the more so when it is plentiful.  In other words, if his livelihood has finished [nishlam] he should perform charity, and he should certainly act in this manner if his means are plentiful."

With regard to the expression: “And I will afflict you [a’anekh] no more, ” Rav Yosef teaches:  This means that if he gives charity to others, God will no longer show him signs of poverty [aniyyut].

But isn’t it written: “The lion tears apart for its young,  and it strangles for its lionesses, and it fills its caves with prey, and its den with that which was torn apart” (Nahum 2:13). The description in the verse clearly indicates that it is the typical manner of a lion to tear apart its prey. The Talmud answers that each phrase of this verse is referring not to a situation where the lion catches prey for its own immediate use, but to one where it provides food for its young,  as it says: “The lion tears apart for its young”; to provide food for its lionesses: “And it strangles for its lionesses”;  to provide food for the young cubs in its lair: “And it filled its lair with prey”;  and to provide food for the young cubs in its den: “And its den with that which was torn apart. ” Therefore, we cannot learn from this verse that it is the typical manner of a lion to tear apart prey for its own immediate use."
