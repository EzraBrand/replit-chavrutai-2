Before answering this question, the Talmud cites another discussion as to why the <i>halakha</i> of misuse of consecrated property does not apply to blood. <b>Ulla says: The verse states</b> with regard to blood: “For the life of the flesh is in the blood, <b>and I have given it to you</b> upon the altar to make atonement for your souls” (Leviticus 17:11). “To you” indicates that <b>it shall be yours; </b> it is not the property of the Temple, so it is not subject to the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property."
