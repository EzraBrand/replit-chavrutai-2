Why does the verse state:  “When any man has an issue out of his flesh, his issue is impure” (Leviticus 15:2)?

And furthermore, a zav becomes impure by three sightings of gonorrhea-like discharge on one day like he becomes impure by three such sightings on three consecutive days, as it is taught in a baraita: The verse links the impurity of the male,  i.e., a zav, to the number of sightings on the same day or on consecutive days, and of the female zava to the number of consecutive days on which she experiences sightings of blood. And by contrast, a zava becomes impure if she has a discharge by accident, and does not become impure by three sightings on one day like she becomes impure by sightings on three consecutive days.  Therefore, the Mishnah counts them as two separate cases."

The verse teaches that a zav is not impure until his issue emerges out of his flesh.

Rabba could have said to you: And according to your reasoning,  with regard to a non-Jew man and a non-Jew woman as well,  do they transmit impurity and their movement does not transmit impurity? Wasn’t it taught in a baraita with regard to the verse: “Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, when any man has an emission from his body, his emission is impure” (Leviticus 15:2), by Torah law, only the children of Israel become impure through the emission of a zav, and non-Jews do not become impure through the emission of a zav?

Wasn’t it taught in a baraita: “Every bed on which a zav is lying is ritually impure and every vessel on which he is sitting shall be ritually impure” (Leviticus 15:4). I might have thought, based on this verse, that if one overturned a vessel the size of a se’a and sat on it, or overturned a vessel the size of a half-se’a [tarkav] and sat on it,  the vessel would become ritually impure.  Therefore, the verse states: On which the zav is sitting,  i.e., that which is designated for sitting, excluding that vessel with regard to which one says to the zav: Stand and we will perform our labor with the vessel. In that case, because the vessel is primarily used for purposes other than sitting, it does not become ritually impure even when the zav sits on it."

The Talmud poses a question: And how many people are considered many for the purposes of this law? Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Three,  as can be learned from the laws of a woman who experiences a discharge of uterine blood after her menstrual period [zava]: “Days” indicates two,  which is the minimal number justifying use of the plural noun. The term “many days” (Leviticus 15:25) therefore indicates a total of three. R' Yitzḥak said: Ten, as the term “assembly” is written in relation to the Gibeonites, and it is taught elsewhere that an assembly is comprised of at least ten members."

The Talmud explains the dilemma: Since God states:  “And if a woman has a flow of her blood many days” (Leviticus 15:25), does this indicate that the woman is not impure unless the blood flows,  i.e., if it is wet, yes,  she is impure, whereas if it is dry she is not impure? Or perhaps this phrase: “If a woman has a flow of her blood, ” is merely referring to the normal manner that menstrual blood emerges, but actually even dry blood renders the woman impure."

The Talmud answers: If not for the term “her blood, ” I would say the verse is teaching that a woman who gives birth is impure as in her menstruation, and not as in her ziva, and therefore, even if she experienced bleeding during her days of ziva in a state of resting from labor pains, she remains pure.

But if she experienced bleeding on only one or two days she is rendered a lesser zava, and she must observe a clean day for each day she experiences a discharge. What is the reason?  It is written:  “And if a woman has an issue of her blood many days…all the days of the issue of her impurity she shall be as in the days of her menstruation: She is impure” (Leviticus 15:25).

Ulla said: So that she will not become unappealing to her husband.  That would be the result if all ornamentation was prohibited. As it was taught in a baraita with regard to the verse: “And of her that is sick in her menstrual status [niddata]” (Leviticus 15:33), the Elders of the early generations said that this verse comes to teach us that the menstruating woman should be distanced from her husband in all senses, like a person ostracized [menudeh] by the rabbis. This includes that she may not paint her eyes blue, and she may not rouge [pokeset] her face, and she may not adorn herself with colorful clothing. Until R' Akiva came and taught: If you do so, you are making her unappealing to her husband, and her husband will consequently divorce her.  Therefore, extreme strictures should not be instituted. Rather, what is the meaning of that which the verse states: “And of her that is sick in her menstrual status”? She shall remain prohibited in her menstrual status even after the flow of blood has stopped until she immerses in the water of a ritual bath."

But wasn’t it taught in a baraita: From where is it derived that nothing should precede the trousers when the priest dresses? The verse states: “And he shall have linen trousers upon his flesh” (Leviticus 16:4)? However, according to the proposed interpretation of the Mishnah, the priests donned the other sacred garments and put on the trousers after them."

In other words, just as he must have the intention to take the incense, so too, he must intend to bring all of it.

Accordingly, since the offering brought by a woman after childbirth is not to atone for a sin, but due to the fact that she went through a period of ritual impurity, the goat offering will not atone for her."

The restrictive term “from” indicates that it atones for some impurities but not for all impurities. What do we find is the impurity that the verse differentiates from all other impurities?  We find it with regard to the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods. It is specifically for this transgression that the Torah provides one with the means of achieving atonement, i.e., by bringing a sliding-scale offering. So too here,  since the verse limits the atonement of the goat offering to transgressions involving impurity, it is logical that it can also atone only for the defiling of the Temple or its sacrificial foods.

          "talmudFullText": "The Talmud continues with another baraita connected to this debate. With regard to the garments of the High Priest, the Torah states: “And Aaron shall go into the tent of meeting, and he shall take off the linen garments that he had put on when he went into the Sanctuary, and shall leave them there” (Leviticus 16:23). This verse teaches that the linen garments worn by the High Priest during the Yom Kippur service require storing away,  i.e., they may not be used again. R' Dosa says:  They do not have to be stored away, because although they may not be used again by the High Priest on a subsequent Yom Kippur, they are acceptable for use for a common priest. And what,  then, is the meaning when the verse states: “And shall leave them there, ” which implies that they are not to be used again? It means that the High Priest himself may not use them on a subsequent Yom Kippur for service in the Holy of Holies; it does not mean that they may not be used at all."

He already completed the service in the Sanctuary. He comes only to remove the spoon and the coal pan that he left in the Holy of Holies, as the entire Torah portion in which the Yom Kippur service is discussed was stated in the order in which it is performed in the Temple except for this verse,  which should have been written after the sacrifice of the burnt-offering in the following verse. The High Priest does not remove the spoon immediately after he places it in the Holy of Holies. Rather, after placing it there, he emerges and performs certain services outside the Sanctuary and changes his garments again. The Talmud asks: What is the reason that the High Priest interrupts the inner rite of the incense to offer his ram and the people’s ram before removing the spoon and the coal pan?"

Therefore, the verse states: “And Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting and he shall remove the linen garments that he put on” (Leviticus 16:23). What is the meaning when the verse states: “That he put on”? Does a person remove any garments other than those that he put on?

One who abstains from bathing,  however, does not know and feel the affliction now,  but only later. By contrast, with regard to vows, where it is written: “Every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul,  her husband may uphold it, or her husband may nullify it” (Numbers 30:14), the reference is to a matter that leads to affliction, and if she does not bathe for an extended period of time, it eventually leads to affliction.

If one violates a prohibition and repents, repentance suspends his punishment and Yom Kippur atones for his sin, as it is stated: “For on this day shall atonement be made for you,  to purify you from all your sins” (Leviticus 16:30). If one commits a transgression that warrants karet or a sin punishable by death from the earthly court and then repents, repentance and Yom Kippur suspend his punishment, and suffering absolves and completes the atonement, as it is stated: “Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with strokes” (Psalms 89:33)."

The phrase “their sacrifices, which they slaughter” is interpreted as referring to offerings that I have previously permitted for you to slaughter on private altars. This verse teaches that those offerings may now be sacrificed only inside the Tabernacle. The phrase “upon the open field” tells you that in the case of one who slaughters an offering on a private altar during a period when the prohibition against sacrificing on private altars is in effect, even if he sacrifices the offering to God, the verse ascribes him blame as if he sacrificed it upon the open field in idolatrous worship."

Reish Lakish says:  The dispute in the Mishnah concerns four or five limbs that were offered up in different lapses of awareness. As one Sage,  R' Yosei, holds: When it is written: “To sacrifice it” (Leviticus 17:9), which teaches the halakha that for offering up a complete item one is liable but that one is not liable for offering up an incomplete item, it is written with regard to a whole animal.  Accordingly, liability to bring a sin offering is incurred only once one offers up the entire animal, even if that was done limb by limb. And the other Sage,  R' Shimon, holds that that verse is written with regard to each and every limb of an animal. Accordingly, one is liable for each limb he offered up. But with regard to the offering up of one limb in parts, everyone agrees that a person is liable to bring only one sin offering. According to R' Shimon this would apply even if that were the only limb that was offered up; according to R' Yosei this would apply only if the rest of the animal had already been offered up."

As the Talmud will state, there is a principle that once the mitzva involving a consecrated item has been performed, the item is no longer subject to the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property. Accordingly, the term “it is” teaches that just as after atonement,  i.e., after the blood has been presented on the altar, it is not subject to the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property, as the mitzva has already been performed, so too, before atonement,  i.e., before the blood has been presented on the altar, it is not subject to the prohibition of misuse of consecrated property."

According to R' Abbahu’s opinion, one may derive from this verse that in addition to the prohibition against eating blood, it is prohibited to benefit from it as well. And we learned in a Mishnah: Both these and these,  the remnants of the blood from sin-offerings brought on the altar and other blood sprinkled on it, descend and mix in the canal from which water leaves the Temple. They then exit to the Kidron Valley and are sold at a special price to gardeners as a fertilizer. And one who does not first purchase the blood from the Temple misuses consecrated property.

Rav Yehuda relates: When I said this halakha before Shmuel, he said to me: Does the Hanukkah light have sanctity that would prohibit one from using its light? Rav Yosef strongly objected to this question: What kind of question is that; does the blood of a slaughtered undomesticated animal or fowl have sanctity? As it was taught in a baraita that the rabbis interpreted the verse: “He shall spill its blood and cover it with dust” (Leviticus 17:13): With that which he spilled, he shall cover.  Just as a person spills the blood of a slaughtered animal with his hand, so too, he is obligated to cover the blood with this hand and not cover it with his foot.  The reason is so that mitzvot will not be contemptible to him. Here too,  one should treat the Hanukkah lights as if they were sacred and refrain from utilizing them for other purposes, so that mitzvot will not be contemptible to him. "

R' Yehuda said: Why was the case of a tereifa stated? If the verse is referring to a live tereifa,  it should not be impure, as the term “a carcass” is stated,  indicating that to impart impurity the bird must be dead. If it is referring to a tereifa that is not alive,  but rather has died of its wounds, it falls within the category of a carcass.

This type of impurity applies only to those birds that are forbidden specifically due to the prohibition: You shall not eat of a carcass,  i.e., kosher birds that died without ritual slaughter. This carcass of a non-kosher animal is excluded,  and is not impure, as it is forbidden not due to the prohibition: You shall not eat of a carcass,  but rather due to the prohibition: You shall not eat a non-kosher bird, to render yourself impure with it.

It is necessary for this to be written with regard to the carcass of a kosher bird so that you should not say as follows: Since a non-kosher bird is forbidden for consumption, and a tereifa is forbidden for consumption,  therefore just as a non-kosher bird does not impart impurity, so too a tereifa does not impart impurity.

Presumably, the punishment administered to one who has sex with the daughter of his daughter stems from the kinship with his daughter. When the verse states with regard to the daughter of his daughter: “For theirs is your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10), his daughter is included."

Then, it is derived from a verbal analogy between the word “lewdness” (Leviticus 18:17) and the word “lewdness” in the verse: “And if a man takes a woman and her mother, it is lewdness; they shall be burned with fire both him and them, and there shall be no lewdness among you” (Leviticus 20:14)."

As it is written: “The nakedness of a woman and her daughter…you shall not take her son’s daughter, or her daughter’s daughter, to uncover her nakedness: They [henna] are near kinswomen” (Leviticus 18:17). And it is stated: “The nakedness of your son’s daughter, or of your daughter’s daughter; for they [henna] are your own nakedness” (Leviticus 18:10). This latter verse is interpreted as referring to one’s granddaughter from the woman he raped (see Yevamot 97a). The verbal analogy teaches that although one’s daughter from the woman he raped is not mentioned in the verse, she too is included with one’s granddaughter, just as a daughter and a granddaughter are equated in Leviticus 18:17."

It is in order to sentence one who has sex with his sister with karet, and not with lashes.  This is the source for the opinion that those liable to receive karet are not flogged."

Therefore, the verse states: “You shall fear every man his mother and his father and you shall keep My Shabbatot,  I am YHWH your God” (Leviticus 19:3). This verse teaches: All of you are obligated in My honor.  This proves that the tanna does not differentiate between desecrating Shabbat, which is a severe prohibition, and a priest becoming ritually impure with impurity imparted by a corpse, which is a lighter prohibition."

And which is this?  It is intent to consume the offering beyond its designated time, as one derives by way of verbal analogy between “iniquity” and “iniquity” from notar (Leviticus 19:8), that “bear his iniquity” means that one is liable to receive karet. The comparison is apt since notar is similar to intent to consume the offering beyond its designated time in that both prohibitions share the features mentioned above that form the acronym: Zayin, beit.

The verse states: “You shall not put a stumbling block before the blind” (Leviticus 19:14). Causing another person to sin is like placing a stumbling block before a blind person; one who does so violates this prohibition. The prohibition of giving a limb from a living animal to a non-Jew is apparently due only to the prohibition of placing a stumbling block. However, it is permitted for one to throw it to dogs.  Therefore, despite the fact that the verse says: “You shall not eat it,” apparently there is no prohibition against benefiting from this prohibited item. This challenges R' Abbahu’s principle."

Consequently, according to the one who holds this verbal analogy, one extra hillul remains from which to derive the blessing.

With regard to one who also oppresses a convert as well, three prohibitions are written:  “And you shall neither mistreat a convert, nor oppress him” (Exodus 22:20); “And you shall not oppress a convert (Exodus 23:9); “And you shall not be to him like a creditor” (Exodus 22:24). This last prohibition is a general prohibition, in which converts are included.  Consequently, it is not correct that one who oppresses a convert violates only two prohibitions. Rather, both this one, who verbally mistreats a convert, and that one, who oppresses him, violate three prohibitions. "

The phrase “who commits adultery with the wife of another man” serves to exclude the wife of a minor,  as the marriage of a minor is invalid.

But with regard to an ox that copulated with a male, from where do we derive that the animal is to be killed?"

This obligation to obey a parent is a positive mitzva,  as it is written: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:12), and that obligation of a priest to refrain from becoming impure is both a prohibition:  “To the dead among his people he shall not defile himself” (Leviticus 21:1), and a positive mitzva:  “You shall be holy” (Leviticus 19:2); and the principle is that a positive mitzva does not come and override a prohibition and a positive mitzva.

The Talmud answers: It might enter your mind to say that a priest does not become impure for his brother of flawed lineage, since it is written with regard to priests: “None shall defile himself for the dead among his people except for his kin, that is near unto him” (Leviticus 21:1–2), and the Master said “his kin”; this is his wife,  and a priest may defile himself for his wife. But it is written: “He shall not defile himself, being a husband among his people, to profane himself” (Leviticus 21:4), implying that he may not defile himself for his wife. This apparent contradiction is resolved as follows: There is a husband who does become impure for his wife, and there is a husband who does not become impure. How so? He becomes impure for his wife if she was fit and was permitted to a priest, but he does not become impure for his wife if she was unfit to marry a priest."

As it is derived by verbal analogy between profanation mentioned in this context and profanation from teruma,  as the verse states in this context: “And not profane the name of their God” (Leviticus 21:6), and the verse states with regard to teruma: “Lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it” (Leviticus 22:9). It can be inferred from this verbal analogy that one who disqualifies teruma,  i.e., one who immersed that day, profanes the Temple service,  and one who does not disqualify teruma,  i.e., one who creates a bald spot or one who destroys his beard, does not profane the service.

Since in general, it is a tear even without rending the neckline asunder, one can read here with regard to the High Priest: “Nor rend his garments” (Leviticus 21:10). This supports the opinion of Rav that the High Priest does not rend his garments from above like others do; rather, he rends his garments from below."

The Talmud answers: It is different because it is a positive mitzva whose application is not equal for all.  There are two lenient aspects to this mitzva: It is a positive mitzva and not a prohibition, and it applies only to the High Priest and not to all Jews. Even R' Yeshevav would agree that according to R' Akiva, a child born from sex between a High Priest and a non-virgin is not a mamzer. However, the High Priest may not sustain the woman as his wife.

The Talmud answers: It is necessary lest you say that a shaḥuf does not disqualify the daughter of a priest from partaking of teruma, as God states in the Torah with regard to a priest: “And he shall not disqualify his offspring among his people” (Leviticus 21:15). One might infer from this verse that one who can have offspring disqualifies a woman from partaking of teruma, through forbidden sex, and that one who cannot have offspring does not disqualify a woman from partaking of teruma. Shmuel therefore teaches us that this is not so. In any event, Shmuel states that one can issue a warning on account of a shaḥuf, unlike the initial interpretation of the Mishnah."

Which people are referred to in the phrase “say to them”?  It is referring to those standing at Mount Sinai.  Which people are referred to in the phrase “throughout your generations”?

Since the term “should be unto” denotes marriage, one might say that one who is eligible for betrothal, yes,  he disqualifies the woman; but a non-Jew, who is not eligible for betrothal, does not disqualify her.

The verse: “And they shall not desecrate the sacred items of the children of Israel, which they set apart unto YHWH” (Leviticus 22:15), teaches that only improper intentions for the sake of sacred items,  i.e., offerings, desecrate sacred items, but non-sacred intent does not desecrate sacred items.

With regard to misuse of consecrated property, the verse states: “If any one commits a trespass, and sins through error, in the sacred items of YHWH” (Leviticus 5:15). In the case of teruma, the verse states: “Lest they bear sin for it, and die due to it, if they profane it” (Leviticus 22:9). And with regard to teruma, it is written:  “And they shall not profane the sacred items of the children of Israel” (Leviticus 22:15), which indicates: But not the sacred items of non-Jews,  i.e., one is not liable for partaking of the teruma of non-Jews while he is in a state of ritual impurity."

This verse serves to create an exclusion, teaching that it is these that you may not sacrifice, but you may sacrifice sacred animals that have been used for labor.  The Talmud answers: It was necessary to state the halakha twice. It might enter your mind to say that this halakha, that one may sacrifice animals that have been used for labor, applies only in a case where they were used for permitted labor, but if they were used for prohibited labor,  e.g., on Shabbat, you might say that it is prohibited to bring them as offerings.

With regard to it and its offspring that fell into a pit on a Festival, R' Eliezer says: One may raise the first in order to slaughter it, and then slaughter it; and with regard to the second one, one may provide it sustenance in its place in the pit so that it will not die. R' Yehoshua says: One may raise the first in order to slaughter it, and then reconsider and not slaughter it, and then employ artifice and say that he reconsidered and wants to slaughter the other, and raise the second.

This means that the new crop is prohibited on the day of the waving unless permitted by sacrifice of the offering. And if so, for what reason is it permitted for those distant to eat the new crop from midday and beyond,  when the Temple is standing?

And the Torah also said to count days from Passover and then sanctify the festival of Shavuot with offerings, as it is stated: “You shall count fifty days” (Leviticus 23:16).  From this comparison, we learn the following halakha: Just as the new month is sanctified for the unit of time by which it is counted,  i.e., for one day, so too, Shavuot is sanctified for the unit of time by which it is counted, i.e., for one full week, as it is stated: “Seven complete weeks shall there be” (Leviticus 23:15).

Their reasoning was that the verse states, with regard to the omer offering and the festival of Shavuot that follows seven weeks later: “And you shall count for you from the morrow after the day of rest [hashabbat], from the day that you brought the sheaf [omer] of the waving; seven weeks shall there be complete” (Leviticus 23:15).

As, if they are not free,  the verbal analogy can be logically refuted,  as it is possible to say: What is unique to the omer? That if one found reaped barley one must nevertheless reap more barley for the sake of the mitzva. Can you say the same with regard to the halakhot of the two loaves,  where it is taught that if one found reaped grain one need not reap additional grain for the sacrifice? Apparently, the halakhot of the offering of the two loaves are not parallel to those of the omer. The same might be true with regard to actions that facilitate the performance of the mitzva. In truth,  the verse is free for establishing the verbal analogy. The Talmud explains: Since the verse already states:  “When you come to the land that I am giving to you, and you reap its harvest, then you shall bring the sheaf [omer], the first of your harvest to the priest” (Leviticus 23:10), when the verse restates, “And you shall count for yourselves from the morrow after the day of rest, from the day you have brought the sheaf of the waving, seven whole weeks they shall be” (Leviticus 23:15), why do I need this repetition?

Therefore, when the verse states: “The morrow after the day of rest [hashabbat]” (Leviticus 23:16), it means: The morrow after the Festival,  as the determination of Festivals is by the court.

However, here,  where one seizes property on behalf of a creditor, this verse does not apply, and therefore the Rabbis did not rule that the action of the 3rd party is ineffective.

Only after one has cut virtually the entire field should he leave an uncut corner for the poor. He should not designate an area for pe’a in the middle of the field in the course of cutting the field. The reasons for this ruling are: Due to robbing the poor, and due to causing the poor to be idle, and due to suspicion, and due to the verse: “You shall not wholly reap the corner of your field” (Leviticus 23:22). The Talmud explains: Due to robbing the poor;  so that the owner of the house will not see a time when the field is unoccupied and there are no poor people in the area. If he could designate pe’a as he wished, there is room to suspect that he might say to his poor relative: This is pe’a,  in the place and at the time that he chooses.

The Talmud asks: And the Rabbis, what do they do with the verse: On the day?  The Talmud answers: They require it to teach that the mitzva of taking the lulav is specifically during the day and not at night.  The Talmud asks: And from where does R' Eliezer derive that the lulav is taken during the day and not at night?  The Talmud answers: He derives it from the end of the verse: “And you shall rejoice before YHWH your God seven days” (Leviticus 23:40), indicating that the obligation to take the lulav is during the days and not during the nights.  The Talmud asks: And the Rabbis,  why don’t they derive it from that verse? The Talmud answers: If it was derived from there, I would have said: Derive days written with regard to lulav from days written with regard to sukka by means of a verbal analogy; just as there,  with regard to sukka, it means days and even nights, here too,  with regard to lulav, it means days and even nights.

It is as it is written:  “And you shall take for yourselves on the first day the fruit of a beautiful tree, branches of a date palm” (Leviticus 23:40). Branches in the plural indicates that two branches must be taken, one for the lulav and one for placement around the altar. And the Rabbis say:  Although the word is vocalized in the plural, based on tradition it is written kappot,  without the letter vav. Therefore, it is interpreted as if it were written kappat, indicating that only one palm branch need be taken."

With regard to the Temple candelabrum, it is stated: “Outside the veil of the testimony,  in the Tent of Meeting, shall Aaron order it from evening to morning before YHWH continually; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations” (Leviticus 24:3). It must be understood: And does God require its light for illumination at night? Didn’t the children of Israel, all forty years that they walked in the wilderness, walk exclusively by His light,  the pillar of fire? Rather,  the lighting of the candelabrum is testimony to mankind that the Shekhina rests among Israel.  The Talmud asks: What is this testimony? Rav said: That is the westernmost lamp in the candelabrum in which the measure of oil placed was the same measure of oil as was placed in the other lamps, and nevertheless he would light the others from it each day and with it he would conclude,  i.e., the westernmost lamp would continue burning throughout the day after all the others were extinguished. The rest of the lamps burned only at night, and each night he would relight the rest of the lamps from the westernmost lamp. But isn’t it true that here,  in the Temple, since the lamps were fixed in the candelabrum, it was impossible to light directly from lamp to lamp? There was no alternative to taking a wood chip and lighting the rest of the lamps from the westernmost lamp. Consequently, it is difficult both according to the one who said that one may not light from lamp to lamp due to contempt for the mitzva and according to the one who said that one may not light from lamp to lamp due to weakening the mitzva.

Rather,  this teaches that the Table was not always left in a fixed place; the priests would lift the Table with its shewbread to display the shewbread to the pilgrims standing in the Temple courtyard, and a priest would say to them: See your affection before God.  For this reason, the Table is susceptible to becoming ritually impure."

There are three molds that are used in the Temple in the preparation of the loaves. First, the baker places the shewbread in a mold while it is still dough. And second, there was a type of mold for the shewbread in the oven,  in which the loaves were baked. And when he removes [rodah] the shewbread from the oven, he places it in a 3rd mold so that its shape will not be ruined.  The Talmud asks: But why is a 3rd mold necessary? Let him return the shewbread to the first mold,  in which the dough was kneaded. The Talmud answers: Once the dough is baked, it rises,  and no longer fits into the first mold."

These instructions relate to the placing of the witnesses’ hands upon the head of the condemned man, as it is stated: “And let all that heard him place their hands upon his head” (Leviticus 24:14), and to the witnesses’ pushing of the condemned man from a platform the height of two stories."

And if the verse is referring to one who sinned on Shabbat after forewarning, would one who smites an animal be obligated to pay for it?  He is executed and certainly exempt from payment. Rather, isn’t the verse clearly referring to a case during the week? "

And what is the reason the rabbis said that in cases of monetary law we do not need inquiry and interrogation?  It is an ordinance instituted by the rabbis so as not to lock the door in the face of potential borrowers.

And what is the reason that the rabbis said that in cases of monetary law we do not require inquiry and interrogation of witnesses? The Talmud answers: The rabbis established this exemption so as not to lock the door in the face of potential borrowers.  If inquiry and interrogation of the witnesses would be required in order to have the court rule that the lender can collect payment of a loan, lenders would be deterred by the difficulty of proving the matter and might cease to lend money to the poor.

This teaches that there is a requirement to add extra time to the sanctity of the Sabbatical Year, and not work the land both before and after."

Because one is prohibited from discarding fruit grown during the Sabbatical year, the question is raised: From when may one no longer cut trees during the Sabbatical year as he thereby damages the fruit? Beit Shammai say: All trees, from when the blossoms fall off and fruit begins to emerge in its earliest stage. And Beit Hillel say:  There is a distinction between different types of trees. Carob trees may not be cut from when they form chains of carobs, vines may not be cut misheyegaru,  explained below, olives from when they blossom, and all other trees from when fruit emerges. "

If it is speaking of one who sells himself,  it is already stated:  “He shall labor with you until the Jubilee Year” (Leviticus 25:40)."

As, if God had written only “forever, ” I would say that this actually means forever,  i.e., for his entire life. Therefore, God writes: “And you shall return. ”"

The words “it shall be a Jubilee” come to teach that although they did not release property to its original owners, and although they did not sound the shofar, it is nevertheless a Jubilee Year, and the halakhot of the Jubilee year apply. One might have thought that although they did not send free the slaves it is also still a Jubilee Year. Therefore, the verse states: “It shall be, ” this being a term of limitation.

This last prohibition is a general prohibition, in which converts are included.  Consequently, it is not correct that one who oppresses a convert violates only two prohibitions. Rather, both this one, who verbally mistreats a convert, and that one, who oppresses him, violate three prohibitions. "

Rav said: He does have the right to a claim of fraud against him,  and therefore the seller must reimburse the purchaser, as he cannot abrogate the Torah prohibition “And you shall not wrong one another” (Leviticus 25:17). And Shmuel said: He does not have the right to a claim of fraud against him.  It is evident from here that according to Rav, one cannot make a stipulation that contradicts Torah law."

          "talmudFullText": "As it is taught in a baraita, with regard to a verse that deals with one who sells ancestral land: “And he shall redeem that which his brother has sold” (Leviticus 25:25), this redemption is optional,  i.e., if he wishes to do so he may redeem the land. Do you say that it is optional or is it nothing other than an obligation? The verse states concerning an ancestral field that was sold: “And if a man has no one to redeem it” (Leviticus 25:26). This verse is puzzling: But is there a man in Israel who does not have redeemers?  Every Jew has a relative of some sort, even if he must trace his family tree back all the way to Jacob. Rather,  this is referring to one who has a relative who does not want to purchase,  i.e., redeem, the land, as he has permission to refrain from doing so, since this redemption is optional. This is the statement of R' Yehoshua. "

The Talmud presents the two sides of the dilemma: Does one derive the verbal analogy of “ge’ullato” (Leviticus 25:29) and “ge’ullato” (Leviticus 25:26) from an ancestral field in this manner: Just as an ancestral field cannot be partially redeemed and yet it can be redeemed by relatives, so too, this house also cannot be partially redeemed and yet it can be redeemed by relatives?

And the Talmud raises a contradiction from that which is written with regard to one who seeks to redeem an ancestral field that he sold: “And he acquires the means and finds sufficient funds for his redemption” (Leviticus 25:26). The term “and finds” serves to exclude one who, in order to accrue funds to redeem his field, sells a field that was found in his possession when he originally sold the field. It means that he may not sell land that he owns in a distant place and redeem land that he owns in a proximate place, or sell a low-quality tract of land and redeem with the funds accrued from that sale high-quality land. One may not exploit his right to redeem his land for his own advantage. This baraita indicates that the term “and finds” indicates an item that was not there at the time but presents itself later."

With regard to this halakha, A baraita states: Why must the verse state: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption” (Leviticus 25:32)? Since it is stated with regard to the ancestral field of an Israelite: “According to the number of years of the crops he shall sell to you” (Leviticus 25:15), from which it is derived that one cannot redeem an ancestral field less than two years after its sale, one might have thought that this should also be so with regard to this Levite who sold his field. Therefore, the verse states: “The Levites shall have a perpetual right of redemption, ” which teaches that a Levite may redeem his field immediately."

It is because one might have thought: A Levite may always redeem from an Israelite the house that he sold, as this Levite’s power was enhanced,  in that he can redeem always, and that Israelite’s power was diminished,  as he may redeem only within one year. But a Levite may not always redeem from another Levite, as this one’s power was enhanced and that one’s power was equally enhanced.  Rather, the Levite may redeem only within one year of the sale. Therefore, the verse states:  “And if a man purchases from the Levites, ” which literally means: And if a man redeems from the Levites, which teaches that even a Levite who redeems a house purchased by another Levite can always redeem the house."

The Talmud asks: If so, let us derive from it a general halakha that the value of enhancement need not be returned. The Talmud answers: The two cases are dissimilar, as there,  in the baraita, it is a full-fledged sale, and the Jubilee released it, as it is a release of the King,  a Divine decree. Since the buyer had been in full ownership of the field, he keeps the value of the enhancement that occurred while it was his. By contrast, one who receives a field to cultivate is not an owner."

The juxtaposition of the dedicated field of a priest to the ancestral field of an Israelite teaches us that this is not the halakha, as the verse states: “His ancestral field shall be for the priest” (Leviticus 27:31). The verse teaches that with regard to the ancestral field of a priest that he inherited from his father, yes,  it remains in the possession of that priest in perpetuity, but with regard to his dedicated field, it does not remain in his possession in perpetuity; rather, it is divided among the members of the priestly watch serving at the beginning of the Jubilee Year."

R' Elazar ben Yehuda, said: Due to the sin of failure to separate ḥalla from the dough, no blessing takes effect on the grain gathered in the storehouse and a curse spreads to the prices of crops, which increase, and they plant seeds and others eat their yield, as it is stated: “I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror [behala] over you, even consumption and fever, that shall make the eyes to fail and the soul to languish; and you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it” (Leviticus 26:16).

Granted, with regard to valuations, as it is stated:  “Speak to the children of Israel” (Leviticus 27:2), one can derive that the children of Israel can take a valuation vow but non-Jews cannot take a valuation vow.  One might have thought that non-Jews cannot be valuated either. Therefore, the verse states: “Man” (Leviticus 27:2), so as to include a non-Jew in only one aspect of the halakhot of valuations, i.e., that a non-Jew can be the subject of a valuation. This does not negate the derivation from “the children of Israel” that non-Jews are generally excluded."

One explicit utterance is for prohibition,  i.e., when one takes a vow, he is bound to keep it, and one explicit utterance is for dissolution,  i.e., in the event that he provides a halakhic authority with a reason why the vow should no longer apply, the vow can be dissolved and he will no longer be bound by it.

After all, aren’t valuations juxtaposed to vows, as the verse states: “When a man shall clearly utter a vow of persons to YHWH, according to your valuation. ” And isn’t it taught in a baraita with regard to a verse dealing with vows:  “Any man [ish] from the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, who sacrifices his offering, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their gift offerings, which are sacrificed to YHWH as a burnt-offering” (Leviticus 22:18), what is the meaning when the verse states the extra emphasis: “Any man [ish ish]”?

Does he have a portion in it? Therefore, the baraita must not be referring to an impure priest. Rather,  there is another reason why he has no right to the payment. This halakha is derived through a verbal analogy between the phrase “even the priest’s [lakohen]” (Numbers 5:8) written in this context, and the phrase “to the priest [lakohen]” (Leviticus 27:21) from the verse stated concerning an ancestral field,  which, if consecrated and then redeemed by another does not revert to its original owner in the Jubilee Year, but is given to the priests, as the baraita will now explain."

The Talmud asks: What is the reason for the opinion of R' Meir?  The Talmud answers: It is written with regard to a male between the ages of twenty and sixty: “Your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver” (Leviticus 27:3), and the verses likewise specify the valuations for other individuals. And it is also written:  “Your valuations shall be according to the shekel of the Sanctuary” (Leviticus 27:25). This teaches that the valuation is either fifty shekels for one who vows to donate the valuation of a man between twenty and sixty, or one shekel,  if he cannot afford to pay fifty."

The verse states:  “Twenty gera shall be the shekel,” whereby the term “shall be” denotes an increase.

The Talmud raises a difficulty: But one can say instead that the term “it” teaches that the prohibition against selling applies to dedications, but not to the animal tithe offering. The Talmud answers: The prohibition against selling applies to the animal tithe offering, with regard to which the expression of redemption is written, just like dedications, while the term “it” limits the prohibition to the firstborn offering."

The reason is that the exclusion of diverse kinds can be derived by means of a verbal analogy from the term “under” in this verse, and the word “under” in a verse that deals with sacrificial animals: “When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat is born, it shall be seven days under its mother” (Leviticus 22:27).

The reason is that this can be derived by a verbal analogy between the term passing,  in the verse: “And you shall cause to pass to YHWH all that open the womb” (Exodus 13:12), and the same term passing, from a verse concerning animal tithe:  “And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, any one that passes under the rod, the 10th shall be sacred unto YHWH” (Leviticus 27:32). This verbal analogy teaches that if the firstborn of a ewe or a she-goat is an animal of diverse kinds it is not considered a firstborn with regard to the halakhot of firstborn animals, which means that Rava’s principle is not necessary here."

Second, both are sanctified by human action rather than intrinsically consecrated.  Additionally, they are not included among the gifts to the priest. Finally, both begin life as regular animals rather than as animals with the unique status of being born first. The Talmud accepts this objection: Rather, R' Shimon derives the halakha from a verbal analogy between the term: “You shall pass” (Exodus 13:12), written with regard to the firstborn, and the term: “Whatsoever passes under the rod” (Leviticus 27:32), stated with regard to tithed animals."

          "talmudFullText": "The Talmud comments: This was also taught in a baraita: Measures of punishments are halakha transmitted to Moses from Sinai. Others say:  These measures were instituted by the court of Jabez.  The Talmud questions this: How can this be? Isn’t it written: “These are the mitzvot which YHWH commanded Moses for the children of Israel at Mount Sinai” (Leviticus 27:34). The word “these” underscores that a prophet is not permitted to introduce any new element related to the Torah and its mitzvot from here on. Rather,  over the course of time, the people forgot the measures; subsequently the prophets reestablished the measures and taught them to the masses."
