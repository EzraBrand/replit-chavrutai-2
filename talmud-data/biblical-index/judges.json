          "talmudFullText": "Rav Ashi strongly objects to this interpretation of the verse: From where do you derive that this word bezek is a term related to the verb meaning to break apart,  so that it means shards? Perhaps it is the name of a town,  and it means that Saul counted them in Bezek, as it is written: “And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek” (Judges 1:5), which shows that Bezek is the name of a place. The Talmud answers: Indeed, the proof is not from that verse but from here,  where it says: “And Saul summoned the people and numbered them by sheep” (I Samuel 15:4), meaning that Saul tallied his soldiers by having each one take a sheep and put it aside to represent him in the count."

Since the name devir was changed to Kiriath Sefer, the Persians referred to a sifra, i.e., a book, as devir."

What is the reason for when punishments are annulled? Because the Jewish people blessed God.  When one recites: Amen, may His great name be blessed, and blesses God, his punishment is annulled.

It is written here,  in the verse above: “When punishments [pera’ot] are annulled. ” And it is written there,  with regard to the sin of the Golden Calf: “And Moses saw that the nation was wild [paru’a],  for Aaron had let them loose for anyone who might rise against them” (Exodus 32:25). Even one with the wildness of idolatry is forgiven. Reish Lakish said: One who answers amen with all his strength, they open the gates of the Garden of Eden before him, as it is stated: “Open the gates, and a righteous nation shall come who keeps the faith” (Isaiah 26:2).

Do you say it means the left arm, or is it only the right arm? The verse states: “Even My hand [yadi] has laid the foundation of the earth, and My right hand [vimini] has spread out the heavens” (Isaiah 48:13). And another verse states: “Her hand [yadah] she put to the tent pin, and her right hand [viminah] to the workmen’s hammer” (Judges 5:26), and another verse states: “Why do You withdraw Your hand [yadkha], even Your right hand [viminekha]? Draw it out of Your bosom and consume them” (Psalms 74:11). All these verses employ the term yad with regard to the left hand, and use the term yamin, literally, right, without the term yad, to indicate the right hand."

At first when you, the Jewish people, merely accepted the Torah upon yourselves it was with one of your eyes;  however, when you actually perform the mitzvot it will be with both of your eyes. Ulla said with regard to the sin of the Golden Calf: Insolent is the bride who is promiscuous under her wedding canopy. Rav Mari, son of the daughter of Shmuel, said: What verse alludes to this? “While the king was still at his table my spikenard gave off its fragrance” (Song of Songs 1:12). Its pleasant odor dissipated, leaving only an offensive odor. Rav said:  Nevertheless, it is apparent from the verse that the affection of God, is still upon us, as it is written euphemistically as “gave off its fragrance,” and the verse did not write, it reeked.  And A baraita states: About those who are insulted and do not insult, who hear their shame and do not respond, who act out of love and are joyful in suffering, the verse says: “And they that love Him are as the sun going forth in its might” (Judges 5:31)."

Rav Yosef strongly objected to this:  With regard to what use was this dilemma raised? If you say it was raised with regard to the matter of the prohibition of idolatry, let it only be like Zevuv, the Baal of Ekron,  which was the size and form of a fly, as it was taught in a baraita with regard to the verse: “And they made Baal Berit into their god” (Judges 8:33). The rabbis said that this is referring to Zevuv, the Baal of Ekron.  It teaches that each and every person made an image of his god and placed it in his pocket. When he remembered it, he removed it from his pocket and embraced and kissed it.  Apparently, even idolatry the size of a fly falls under the rubric of the prohibition of idolatry. Rather,  the dilemma is: What is the halakha with regard to the matter of impurity?  The two sides of the dilemma are as follows: Since an idol is juxtaposed to a creeping animal, just as a creeping animal transmits impurity when it is a lentil-bulk, so too, idolatry transmits impurity when it is a lentil-bulk. Or perhaps idolatry is juxtaposed to a corpse,  and just as a corpse transmits impurity only when it is at least an olive-bulk, so too, idolatry transmits impurity only when it is at least an olive-bulk.

R' Yoḥanan says: Grinding is nothing other than a language of a transgression of sex, and so the verse says: “Then let my wife grind unto another man” (Job 31:10). This teaches that each and every Philistine man brought his wife to the prison in order that she should be impregnated by Samson. Rav Pappa said: This is an example of the folk saying that people say: Before a wine drinker,  bring wine; before one who digs in the ground,  bring figs.  So too, Samson, who married Philistine women, was brought more Philistine women while in prison."

Had they asked, they indeed would have been told that they would not succeed. But on the last time, when they did check and inquire whether they would be successful, the UrimVeTummim agreed with them that they should go to battle and that they would succeed, as it is stated: “And Pinehas, the son of Elazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days, saying: Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And God said: Go up, for tomorrow I will deliver him into your hand” (Judges 20:28)."

As it is written: “And the men of Israel had taken an oath in Mizpah, saying: None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife” (Judges 21:1). The Talmud asks: What verse did the rabbis of that time interpret that enabled them to dissolve this vow? The verse states: “None of us, ” and not:  None of our children;  therefore, the oath applied only to the generation that had taken the oath."

After the tragic incident at Gibeah, for which the tribe of Benjamin was blamed, the other tribes ostracized them. They took an oath to prohibit themselves from marrying a member of the tribe of Benjamin, as it is stated: “And the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying: None of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife” (Judges 21:1). The Talmud asks: What did they expound that enabled them to dissolve this oath? Rav said:  They understood the verse literally, as it states: “None of us, ” and not:  None of our children,  i.e., the oath applied only to the generation that took the oath, not their descendants."

The Talmud asks: But would the tanna of the baraita provide a sign in this manner for an area of a strip of land? The Talmud answers: Yes,  and a verse also provides a sign in this manner, as it is written: “And they said: Behold, there is the feast of YHWH from year to year in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah” (Judges 21:19). And Rav Pappa said:  The expression: “On the east side,” should be understood as meaning to the east of the highway.  This verse demonstrates that an area as narrow as a road can be used as a sign."
