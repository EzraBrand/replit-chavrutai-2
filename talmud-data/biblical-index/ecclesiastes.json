These seven correspond to the seven references to “vanity” in the verse: “Vanity of vanities, says Kohelet; vanity of vanities, all is vanity” (Ecclesiastes 1:2), counting the plural term “vanities” as two references."

          "talmudFullText": "Since contradictions in Ecclesiastes were mentioned, the Talmud cites additional relevant sources. Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav: The rabbis sought to suppress the book of Ecclesiastes and declare it apocryphal because its statements contradict each other and it is liable to confuse its readers. And why did they not suppress it? Because its beginning consists of matters of Torah and its end consists of matters of Torah.  The ostensibly contradictory details are secondary to the essence of the book, which is Torah. The Talmud elaborates: Its beginning consists of matters of Torah, as it is written: “What profit has man of all his labor which he labors under the sun? ” (Ecclesiastes 1:3), and the rabbis of the school of R' Yannai said:  By inference: Under the sun is where man has no profit from his labor; however, before the sun,  i.e., when engaged in the study of Torah, which preceded the sun, he does have profit. Its ending consists of matters of Torah, as it is written: “The end of the matter, all having been heard: Fear God, and keep His mitzvot; for this is the whole man” (Ecclesiastes 12:13). With regard to this verse, the Talmud asks: What is the meaning of the phrase: For this is the whole man? R' Eliezer said: The entire world was only created for this person. R' Abba bar Kahana said: This person is equivalent to the entire world. Shimon ben Azzai says and some say that Shimon ben Zoma says: The entire world was only created as companion to this man, so that he will not be alone."

This teaches you that a righteous person does not leave the world before an equally righteous person is created, as it is stated: “The sun also rises and the sun also sets” (Ecclesiastes 1:5). The same applies to earlier generations: Before Eli’s sun had gone out, Samuel the Ramathite’s sun was already rising, as it is stated: “And the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying in the Temple of YHWH” (I Samuel 3:3), which teaches that Samuel was already prophesying in the days of Eli."

Before the sun of Eli was extinguished, the sun of Samuel of Ramah had already shone (see I Samuel, chapter 3), and so on throughout the generations. And R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said that R' Yoḥanan said: God saw that righteous people were few,  so He arose and planted some of them in each and every generation to ensure the presence of at least one righteous person in each generation. As it is stated: “For the pillars of the earth are YHWH’s, and He has set the world upon them” (I Samuel 2:8).

There are no new creations after the six days of Creation. Rather,  Moses asked God to bring the opening of Gehenna close to there, so that the assembly of Korah would be buried alive."

As long as it is not interpreted it cannot be fulfilled; the interpretation of a dream creates its meaning. And Rav Ḥisda said: A good dream is not entirely fulfilled and a bad dream is not entirely fulfilled. And Rav Ḥisda said: A bad dream is preferable to a good dream,  as a bad dream causes one to feel remorse and to repent. And Rav Ḥisda said: A bad dream, his sadness is enough for him; a good dream, his joy is enough for him.  This means that the sadness or joy engendered by the dream renders the actual fulfillment of the dream superfluous. Similarly, Rav Yosef said: Even for me, the joy of a good dream negates it.  Even Rav Yosef, who was blind and ill, derived such pleasure from a good dream that it was never actually realized.

He saw the angel Mitatron, who was granted permission to sit and write the merits of Israel. He said:  There is a tradition that in the world above there is no sitting; no competition; no turning one’s back before Him,  i.e., all face the Shekhina; and no lethargy.  Seeing that someone other than God was seated above, he said: Perhaps,  the Talmud here interjects, Heaven forbid, there are two authorities,  and there is another source of power in control of the world in addition to God.

Likewise in one verse it is written: “So I commended mirth” (Ecclesiastes 8:15), and in another verse it is written: “And of mirth: What does it accomplish? ” (Ecclesiastes 2:2). The Talmud answers: This is not difficult,  as the contradiction can be resolved. Vexation is better than laughter means: The vexation of God toward the righteous in this world is preferable to the laughter which God laughs with the wicked in this world by showering them with goodness. I said of laughter: It is praiseworthy, that is the laughter which God laughs with the righteous in the World-to-Come. "

He said to him: It is decreed before Me not to reveal the measure of a person’s days.  Again he requested: Let me know how short-lived I am;  on what day of the week will I die? He said to him: You will die on Shabbat.  David requested of God: Let me die on the first day of the week so that the honor of Shabbat will not be tarnished by the pain of death. He said to him:  On that day the time of the kingdom of your son Solomon has already arrived, and one kingdom does not overlap with another and subtract from the time allotted to another even a hairbreadth.  He said to him: I will cede a day of my life and die on Shabbat eve.  God said to him: “For a day in your courts is better than a thousand” (Psalms 84:11); a single day in which you sit and engage in Torah is preferable to Me than the thousand burnt-offerings that your son Solomon will offer before Me on the altar (see I Kings 3:4)."

R' Yitzḥak said: This teaches that each and every righteous person is given a dwelling place in the World-to-Come in accordance with his honor.  The Talmud offers a parable in which a king enters a city along with his servants. When they enter, they all enter through a single gate;  however, when they sleep, each one is given a dwelling place in accordance with his honor.  So too, although everyone dies, not everyone receives the same reward in the World-to-Come."

He said to him:  We can derive this from the verse: “And your ears shall hear a word behind you, saying: This is the path, walk on it, when you turn to the right or to the left” (Isaiah 30:21). In other words, if people eulogize one by saying that others should follow in his path, he must have a share in the World-to-Come. R' Ḥanina said: Anyone with whom our Rabbis are pleased has a share in the World-to-Come. In interpreting the verse: “And the eulogizers walk about the marketplace” (Ecclesiastes 12:5), the people of the Galilee say: Do things that you will want people to say at your eulogy in front of your bier. The people of Judea say: Do things that you want people to say at your eulogy behind your bier.  The Talmud remarks: And they do not disagree;  this Sage expressed it according to the norm in his place, and this Sage expressed it differently according to the norm in his place.  The custom in the Galilee was that the eulogizers would stand before the bier and the custom in Judea was that eulogizers would stand behind the bier."

Therefore, the verse states: “Nails, ” which are permanent."
