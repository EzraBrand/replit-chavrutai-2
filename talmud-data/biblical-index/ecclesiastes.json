To tell you</b> that <b>just as this goad directs the cow to her furrow to bring forth</b> sustenance for <b>life to the world, so too the words of Torah direct those who study them from the paths of death to the paths of life. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>If so, </b> derive the following from that same analogy: <b>Just as this goad is movable</b> and not rigid, <b>so too matters of Torah are movable</b> in accordance with circumstance and are not permanent. Therefore, <b>the verse states: “Nails, ”</b> which are permanent."
