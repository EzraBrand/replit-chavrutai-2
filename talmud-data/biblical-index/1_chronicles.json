Similarly, “This is [hu] Aaron and Moses” (Exodus 6:26); they remained in their righteousness from the beginning of their life to the end of their life. Similarly, with respect to David: “And David, this was [hu] the youngest” (I Samuel 17:14), indicates that he remained in his humility from beginning to end. Just as in his youth,  when he was still an ordinary individual, he humbled himself before anyone who was greater than him in Torah, so too, in his kingship, he humbled himself before anyone who was greater than him in wisdom.

YHWH shall trouble you this day” (Joshua 7:25). Joshua said to Achan: On this day of your judgment you are troubled, but you will not be troubled in the World-to-Come. And elsewhere it is written: “And the sons of Zerah were Zimri and Ethan and Heman and Calcol and Dara, five of them in all” (I Chronicles 2:6). What do the words “five of them in all” serve to teach? All five sons are destined to receive a share in the World-to-Come.  According to the rabbis, Zimri is Achan, son of Zerah, as will be explained. Since Achan has a share in the World-to-Come, his confession must have achieved atonement for him."

Rav and Shmuel both say that Zimri and Achan are one and the same, but they disagree about his real name. One of them says: His real name was Achan. Why then was he called Zimri?  He was called Zimri because he acted like Zimri,  i.e., just as Zimri had sex with a Midianite woman, Achan had sex with a betrothed young woman. And the other one says: His real name was Zimri. Why then was he called Achan?  He was called Achan because he acted like a snake [she’iken] and caused the punishment of the sins of the Jewish people. "

As everyone initially abandoned her [azavuha] and did not want to marry her because she was sickly and unattractive. The verse additionally states: “And Caleb, the son of Hezron, begot children [holid] of Azubah his wife” (I Chronicles 2:18). The Talmud asks: Why use the term “holid,” begot children?

R' Yoḥanan says:  This teaches us that with regard to anyone who marries a woman for the sake of Heaven,  as he married her due to her righteousness without concern for her appearance, the verse ascribes him credit as if he gave birth to her.

The one who says that it is referring to the houses of the priesthood and the Levites is referring to Aaron and Moses,  who were sons of Jochebed.

Alternatively,  Joab’s house was like the wilderness; just as the wilderness is clean of theft and sexual immorality,  as it is uninhabited, so too, Joab’s house was clean of theft and sexual immorality,  owing to his righteousness.

And when he counted them, he did not take a ransom from them,  and he was punished, as it is written: “So YHWH sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning even to the appointed time” (II Samuel 24:15)."
