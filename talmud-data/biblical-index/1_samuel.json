The Talmud elaborates: From that which is stated here: “And Hannah spoke in her heart, ” the halakha that one who prays must focus his heart on his prayer is derived. And from that which is stated here: “Only her lips moved, ” the halakha that one who prays must enunciate the words with his lips,  not only contemplate them in his heart, is derived. From that which is written here: “And her voice could not be heard, ” the halakha that one is forbidden to raise his voice in his Amida prayer as it must be recited silently. From the continuation of the verse here: “So Eli thought her to be drunk, ” the halakha that a drunk person is forbidden to pray.  That is why he rebuked her."

It is written about Rachel: “And God remembered Rachel” (Genesis 30:22), and it is written about Hannah: “And YHWH remembered her” (I Samuel 1:19). And the meaning of these instances of the term remembering is derived from another instance of the term remembering, with regard to Rosh HaShana, as it is written: “A solemn rest, memorial proclaimed with the blast of a shofar” (Leviticus 23:24).

The Talmud relates how Rav Shimi bar Ukva, and some say Mar Ukva, would regularly study before R' Shimon ben Pazi,  who was well versed in aggada and would arrange the aggada before R' Yehoshua ben Levi.  Once, R' Shimon ben Pazi said to him: What is the meaning of that which is written: “Bless YHWH, my soul, and all that is within me bless His Holy name”?  Rav Shimi bar Ukva said to R' Shimon ben Pazi: Come and see that the attribute of God is not like the attribute of flesh and blood,  as this verse praises the formation of man in his mother’s womb. The attribute of flesh and blood is such that he shapes a form on the wall for all to see, yet he cannot instill it with a spirit and soul, bowels and intestines.  While God is not so,  as God shapes one form within another form,  a child in its mother’s womb, and instills it with spirit and soul, bowels and intestines. And this is the explanation of what Hannah said with regard to the birth of Samuel: “There is none holy like YHWH, for there is none like You, and there is no Rock like our God” (I Samuel 2:2)."

And the verse juxtaposes Hophni to Pinehas; just as Pinehas did not sin, so too Hophni did not sin.  The Talmud asks: How,  then, do I establish the meaning of the verse: “Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the Tent of Meeting” (I Samuel 2:22), which indicates otherwise? The Talmud answers: Since the sons of Eli delayed sacrificing the bird-offerings of women who had given birth, a pair of doves brought as part of the purification process, and this delay caused the women not to go to their husbands in timely fashion, the verse ascribes to Hophni and Pinehas liability as if they had lain with them.  They were guilty of nothing more than negligence and carelessness."

And even though it is written immediately thereafter: “And Samuel told him all the matters, and did not hide from him” (I Samuel 3:18), it is written at the time of Samuel’s death: “And his sons did not follow in his ways” (I Samuel 8:3), indicating that God did to Samuel as he prophesied with regard to Eli, and his own sons did not follow his path.

And it is written with regard to Saul: “From his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people” (I Samuel 9:2).

At that point, Doeg the Edomite said to Saul: Before you inquire as to whether or not he is fit for kingship, inquire as to whether or not he is even fit to enter into the congregation. What is the reason for such doubts? It is that he descends from Ruth the Moabite,  and Moabites are permanently barred from entering the congregation."

The Talmud raises a difficulty: But didn’t R' Elazar say that those on the path to perform a mitzva are not susceptible to harm throughout the process of performing the mitzva? The Talmud responds: In a place where danger is permanent it is different,  as one should not rely on a miracle, as it is written with regard to God’s command to Samuel to anoint David as king in place of Saul: “And Samuel said: How will I go, and Saul will hear and kill me; and God said: Take in your hand a calf and say: I have come to offer a sacrifice to God” (I Samuel 16:2). Even when God Himself issues the command, there is concern with regard to a clear and present danger."

David went and killed Goliath. King Saul said to him: You have a loan in my possession, as I owe you the great wealth that I promised, though David had not given him an actual monetary loan.

I know your insolence and the evil of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle” (I Samuel 17:28); we see that Eliab became angry. And when Samuel went to anoint him after God had told him that one of Yishai’s sons was to be the king, concerning all of the other brothers it is written: “YHWH has not chosen this one” (I Samuel 16:8), whereas with regard to Eliab it is written: “And YHWH said to Samuel: Look not at his appearance, nor at the height of his stature, for I have rejected him” (I Samuel 16:7). This proves by inference that until now He had loved him,  and it was only at this point that Eliab was rejected. Had it not been for his anger, Eliab would have been fit for greatness; but owing to this shortcoming, God rejected him."

If not,  he is exempt from liability. According to Shmuel’s opinion, why is the shepherd exempt from liability?

And it is written with regard to Saul: “From his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people” (I Samuel 9:2). Upon seeing that his clothes fit David, Saul began to fear that it might be David who was destined for the throne, and he therefore inquired into his background. At that point, Doeg the Edomite said to Saul: Before you inquire as to whether or not he is fit for kingship, inquire as to whether or not he is even fit to enter into the congregation. What is the reason for such doubts? It is that he descends from Ruth the Moabite,  and Moabites are permanently barred from entering the congregation."

Rabba bar Shmuel said to him: Yes, I teach this baraita (Tosefta 6:1): A hired worker within his time for receiving wages takes an oath and receives payment. How so?  This applies in a case when the worker said to the employer: You hired me but did not give me my wages, and the other,  the employer, says: I hired you and gave you your wages.

Perhaps a king is different,  and excessive worry is appropriate in that case. Rather, proof that one must make oneself ill over a Torah scholar in need for mercy is from here:  When David speaks of his enemies, Doeg and Ahitophel, who were Torah scholars, he says: “But for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth,  I afflicted my soul with fasting” (Psalms 35:13).

But what is the reasoning of Beit Hillel,  who hold that the mitzva applies only to five sheep, due to the verse: “And five sheep [tzon] made” (I Samuel 25:18)? Why do they not apply the obligation using the broader criterion of two sheep, as the verse quoted by Beit Shammai clearly indicates that two sheep are also called tzon?"

The Talmud answers: There, due to the fear of the night, it is standard practice for a woman to ride and not merely sit on the donkey. And if you wish, say instead: There is no consideration due to the fear of the night that would explain why she was permitted to ride in the regular manner; rather, there is a consideration due to fear of David. And if you wish, say instead: There is no consideration due to fear of David either;  however, there is a consideration due to the fear of the incline when riding down the mountain. "

He said, in explanation of his emotional reaction: If the rebuke of a man of flesh and blood was such that the brothers were unable to respond, when it comes to the rebuke of God all the more so. When R' Elazar reached this verse, he cried: “And Samuel said to Saul: Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up” (I Samuel 28:15). He said: If Samuel the righteous was afraid of judgment when he was raised by necromancy, as he thought he was being summoned for a Divine judgment, all the more so that we should be afraid."

David was from the tribe of Judah, yet he was able to defeat the descendants of Esau. R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani said to him: Whoever read and taught Prophets to you did not read and teach Writings to you, as it is written: “As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zillethai, captains of thousands that were of Manasseh,  and they helped David against the troop” (I Chronicles 12:21–2). The verse in Writings teaches that David’s campaign against Esau was led by Joseph’s descendants, from the family of Manasseh."
