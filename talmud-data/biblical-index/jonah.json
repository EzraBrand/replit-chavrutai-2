I said to him: My son, who permitted this to you? He said to me: There is a local woman and her seven sons to whom this was permitted. On this very bench [safsal], R' Akiva sat and said two statements:  He said that a convert may marry the former wife of his maternal half brother, and he said that the verse “And the word of YHWH came to Jonah a second time, saying” (Jonah 3:1) implies that the Shekhina spoke with him only a second time. However, a 3rd time the Shekhina did not speak with him,  i.e., Jonah did not receive any more prophecies. In any event,  this baraita teaches that a convert may marry the wife of his maternal brother. What, is it not referring to a case where the convert’s brother married her when he himself was already a convert? "

The Talmud explains: In the case of Jonah, from the outset,  the heavenly court told him to say: “Nineveh will be overturned” (Jonah 3:4). Still, he did not know if the sentence would be for the good,  as their corruption would be overturned through repentance, or if it would be for the bad,  as the city would be overturned through destruction. Therefore, the prophecy was never revoked, but simply fulfilled in accordance with one of its possible interpretations."

Rather, Rabba says: At the time that it blows, it silences all the winds before it.  Therefore, it is called ḥarishit, because all other winds are silent [maḥarishot] before it. Since only this wind was blowing, it became very hot. And this is as it is written: “You whose garments are hot, when the earth is still by reason of the south wind” (Job 37:17). R' Taḥalifa bar Rav Ḥisda says that Rav Ḥisda says in explanation of this verse: When are your garments hot,  i.e., when is there the greatest heat?
