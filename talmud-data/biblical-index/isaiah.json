The Talmud asks: But say that the phrase “you yourselves have seen it” signifies prophecy, as it is written: “The vision [ḥazon] of Isaiah ben Amoz” (Isaiah 1:1). The Talmud answers: If so, why do I need the words: “Why then have you become altogether vain”?  Rather, the reference must be to inappropriate licentious gazing."

Ultimately, she merited that kings and prophets emerged from her. Kings emerged from her through David,  who was a descendant of Tamar’s son, Peretz. However, there is no explicit mention that she was the forebear of prophets.  This is derived from that which R' Levi said: This matter is a tradition that we received from our ancestors. Amoz,  father of Isaiah, and Amaziah,  king of Judea, were brothers, and it is written: “The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz” (Isaiah 1:1). Amoz was a member of the Davidic dynasty, and his son, the prophet Isaiah, was also a descendant of Tamar."

A prophet outliving four kings is demonstrated in the opening verses of Hosea, and similarly, as it is stated with regard to Isaiah: “The vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judea and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judea” (Isaiah 1:1)."

From Tamar. Prophets emerged from her, as it is written: “The vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz” (Isaiah 1:1). Kings emerged from her, as seen from David. And R' Levi says: This matter is a tradition that we received from our ancestors: Amoz,  father of Isaiah, and Amaziah,  king of Judea, were brothers.

From where is it derived that a woman who discharges semen even on the 3rd day after sex is ritually impure,  just like one who touches semen (see Leviticus 15:17)? Because the semen remains fit for insemination, it can transmit impurity, as it is stated prior to the revelation at Sinai: “And he said to the people, prepare yourselves for three days,  do not approach a woman” (Exodus 19:15). This three-day separation period ensured that even a woman who discharged semen would be pure. The Mishnah cites another halakha based on a biblical allusion: From where is it derived that one may wash the circumcision on the 3rd day,  meaning the 3rd day after the circumcision, even if it occurs on Shabbat? As it is stated: “And it came to pass on the 3rd day when they were in pain” (Genesis 34:25). The pain of circumcision lasts at least three days, and as long as the child is in pain he is considered to be in danger. The Mishnah cites another halakha with an allusion in the Bible: From where is it derived that one ties a scarlet strip of wool to the head of the scapegoat that is dispatched to Azazel? As it is stated: “If your sins be like scarlet, they will become white like snow” (Isaiah 1:18). Since the goat is offered to atone for sins, red wool is tied to its horns. The Mishnah cites another allusion. From where is it derived that smearing oil on one’s body is like drinking and is similarly prohibited on Yom Kippur? Although there is no proof for this, there is an allusion to it, as it is stated: “And it comes into his inward parts like water and like oil into his bones” (Psalms 109:18). The verse appears to equate smearing oil on one’s body with drinking water."

As it says: “If your sins be like scarlet [kashanim], they will become white like snow” (Isaiah 1:18). The Talmud wonders at this: Why does the verse use the plural form: Kashanim? It should have used the singular form: Kashani. R' Yitzḥak said that God said to the Jewish people:  Even if your sins are as numerous as those years [kashanim] that have proceeded continuously from the six days of Creation until now, they will become white like snow. Rava taught: What is the meaning of that which is written: “Go please and let us reason together, YHWH will say” (Isaiah 1:18)? Why does the verse say: Go please? It should have said: Come please.  And why does the verse say: YHWH will say?  The prophet’s message is based on something that God already said. Therefore, the verse should have said: God said.  Rather, the explanation of this verse is that in the future that will surely come, God will say to the Jewish people: Go please to your Patriarchs, and they will rebuke you. "

The darker shade of a se’et makes it appear as though it is raised above the surrounding skin; this is indicated by the fact that the word se’et means nothing other than raised, and so the verse states: “Upon all the high mountains and upon all the raised up [hanissaot] hills” (Isaiah 2:14). The words hanissaot and se’et share the same Hebrew root and both refer to something raised up. In the verse: “For a se’et and for a sappaḥat” (Leviticus 14:56), the word sappaḥat means nothing other than secondary, and so the verse states: “And he will say: Append me [sefaḥeni] please to one of the priestly classes to eat a piece of bread” (I Samuel 2:36).

As about Michael, it is written: “And one of the seraphim flew to me” (Isaiah 6:6), indicating that with a single flight, the seraph arrived and performed his mission, while regarding Gabriel, it is written: “The man, Gabriel, whom I had seen at the beginning, in a vision, being caused to fly swiftly,  approached close to me about the time of the evening offering” (Daniel 9:21). The double language used in the phrase “to fly swiftly [muaf biaf],” indicates that he did not arrive at his destination in a single flight, but rather, that it took him two flights."

The Talmud asks: Is that verse coming to say that the blessings of redemption and healing should be placed following the blessing of forgiveness? But isn’t it written: “Repent, and be healed” (Isaiah 6:10), which suggests that repentance should be followed by healing?

What is the reason for when punishments are annulled? Because the Jewish people blessed God.  When one recites: Amen, may His great name be blessed, and blesses God, his punishment is annulled.

Isn’t it written that Moses himself said much later: “For I was in dread of the anger and wrath” (Deuteronomy 9:19)? The Talmud answers: There are two types of wrath. And if you wish, say that the army of Ḥeima remained but not the angel itself."

Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: Anyone who is lazy in eulogizing a Torah scholar, it is fitting to bury him alive, as it is stated: “And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnat-seraḥ, which is in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Ga’ash” (Joshua 24:30). This teaches that the mountain raged against them to kill them because they did not eulogize him appropriately. R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said that R' Yoḥanan said: Whoever is lazy in eulogizing a Sage does not live a long life, and his punishment is measure for measure.  Since he was unconcerned with the death of the Sage, in the heavens they will be unconcerned with his death. God conducts Himself in this manner, as it is stated: “In full measure [besase’a], when You send her away You contend with her” (Isaiah 27:8), and the rabbis derived that God punishes from the words: “You contend with her,” and He does so measure for measure, se’a for se’a, from the word sase’a in the verse above."

The people of Judea say: Do things that you want people to say at your eulogy behind your bier.

The two parts of the verse are referring to different categories: “And he sends forth, ” this is a reference to the primary category of Trampling,  as sending forth results in the animal trampling another’s produce and damaging it, and likewise it states:  “Happy are you that sow beside all waters that send forth the feet of the ox and the donkey” (Isaiah 32:20).

It was taught in a baraita that the tanna Abba Binyamin would say: All of my life I have taken great pains with regard to two things: That my prayer should be before my bed and that my bed should be placed north to south.  Abba Binyamin’s statement requires explanation. With regard to his statement: That my prayer should be before my bed,  the Talmud asks, what does before my bed mean? If you say that it literally means that he would stand before his bed and pray, it is difficult, as Rav Yehuda said that Rav said, and some say that R' Yehoshua ben Levi said: From where is it derived that one who prays should have nothing separating between him and the wall? As it is stated: “And Hezekiah turned to face the wall and prayed” (Isaiah 38:2), in order to facilitate his concentration during prayer. That being said, why would Abba Binyamin pray before his bed? Rather, do not say that before my bed refers to where he stood during prayer, but rather, say that he prayed adjacent to the time that he would retire to bed;  he was careful to recite Shema and recite the evening prayer just before going to sleep (Rabbeinu Ḥananel)."

In the following verses it is clear that it refers to acts of creation in the past: “Who forms light and creates [boreh] darkness” (Isaiah 45:7), “Who forms mountains and creates [boreh] wind” (Amos 4:13), or “Who creates [boreh] the heavens and stretches them out” (Isaiah 42:5). Rather, said Rav Yosef: With regard to both bara and boreh, everyone agrees that they mean created. Where they disagree is with regard to the light of the fire or the lights of the fire. As Beit Shammai hold that there is one light in a fire, and Beit Hillel hold that there are many lights in a fire,  as a flame consists of red, green, and white light. That was also taught in a baraita: Beit Hillel said to Beit Shammai: There are many lights in the fire. "

And some say that this dispute is between two amora’im in the West,  i.e., Eretz Yisrael. And who are they?  They are Yehuda and Ḥizkiyya, the sons of R' Ḥiyya. One said they will be made of onyx, and one said of jasper. God said to them: Let it be like this [kedein] and like that [ukhedein],  i.e., let them be formed from both together. This compromise is indicated by the word kadkhod, a combination of this [kedein] and that [ukhedein]."

He would say: Ten strong entities were created in the world,  one stronger than the other. A mountain is strong,  but iron,  which is stronger, cleaves it. Iron is strong,  but fire melts it. Fire is strong,  but water extinguishes it. Water is strong,  but clouds bear it. Clouds are strong,  but wind disperses them. Wind is strong,  but the human body withstands it.  The human body is strong,  but fear breaks it. Fear is strong,  but wine dispels it. Wine is strong,  but sleep drives it off. And death is stronger than them all, but charity saves a person from death, as it is written: “And charity delivers from death” (Proverbs 10:2, 11:4)."

The verse states: “For thus says the High and Lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, also with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit,  to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones” (Isaiah 57:15). Rav Huna and Rav Ḥisda offered differing interpretations of this verse. One says that the verse means: Together with Me is the person who is contrite and humble. In other words, God elevates the humble. And one says that the verse means: I,  God, descend, and am found together with the person who is contrite and humble."

But here,  only one meaning is possible, as, if it enters your mind that ḥalitza here connotes strengthening, then let God write in the Torah: She shall strengthen [ḥaletza] his shoe on his foot [beraglo],  indicating that she should tighten the shoe on his foot, rather than stating: “From on his foot [me’al raglo],” which indicates that she is removing something from his foot."

Do we say that since it is written: “And call Shabbat a delight” (Isaiah 58:13), this implies that any food one eats on Shabbat is considered a delight and not a casual meal, and therefore Shabbat establishes an obligation to tithe, as if the food were fully completed and fit to be eaten as a fixed meal, even for an item that has not had its labor completed? Or perhaps Shabbat establishes an obligation to tithe an item whose labor is completed,  but regarding an item whose labor is not completed it does not establish an obligation to tithe?"

He said to them: If you are accustomed to eating your meal early, make it later on Shabbat; if you are accustomed to making it late, make it earlier on Shabbat. This difference will underscore the uniqueness of Shabbat.

The Talmud answers that although speaking about similar things is generally prohibited on Shabbat, it is permitted in these cases because the verse said: “Nor pursuing your business, nor speaking of it” (Isaiah 58:13), which indicates that your business matters are prohibited to speak of on Shabbat, but the business of Heaven,  matters which have religious significance, is permitted to speak of."

And the treasuries of blessing, as it is written: “He shall receive a blessing from YHWH” (Psalms 24:5)."

R' Yehoshua ben Levi said:  One who sees something in a dream that may be interpreted ambiguously should quickly recite an appropriate verse suggestive of a positive interpretation. For example, one who sees a river in a dream should rise early and recite: “I will extend peace to her like a river, ” before a different verse,  with a negative connotation, can precede it in becoming reality: “For distress will come in like a river” (Isaiah 59:19). One who sees a bird in a dream should rise early and recite: “As birds hovering, so will YHWH of hosts protect Jerusalem, ” before a different verse,  with a negative connotation, can precede it in becoming reality: “As a bird that wanders from her nest,  so is a man that wanders from his place” (Proverbs 27:8). One who sees a pot in a dream should rise early and recite: “Lord, You will establish peace for us, ” before a different verse,  which concludes with a wrathful prophecy, can precede it in becoming reality: “Set on the pot, set it on” (Ezekiel 24:3)."

Those who said that one kindles a lamp believe that because people do not engage in sex while a lamp is lit, the lamp will discourage intimacy.
