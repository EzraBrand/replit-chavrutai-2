          "talmudFullText": "<strong>Mishnah: </strong> The Mishnah continues to cite a series of unrelated <i>halakhot</i> based upon biblical allusions. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that</b> a woman who <b>discharges semen</b> even <b>on the 3rd day</b> after sex <b>is ritually impure, </b> just like one who touches semen (see Leviticus 15:17)? Because the semen remains fit for insemination, it can transmit impurity, <b>as it is stated</b> prior to the revelation at Sinai: “And he said to the people, <b>prepare yourselves for three days, </b> do not approach a woman” (Exodus 19:15). This three-day separation period ensured that even a woman who discharged semen would be pure. The Mishnah cites another <i>halakha</i> based on a biblical allusion: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one may wash the circumcision on the 3rd day, </b> meaning the 3rd day after the circumcision, even if <b>it occurs on Shabbat? As it is stated: “And it came to pass on the 3rd day when they were in pain”</b> (Genesis 34:25). The pain of circumcision lasts at least three days, and as long as the child is in pain he is considered to be in danger. The Mishnah cites another <i>halakha</i> with an allusion in the Bible: <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that one ties a scarlet strip</b> of wool <b>to the head of</b> the <b>scapegoat</b> that is dispatched to Azazel? <b>As it is stated: “If your sins be like scarlet, they will become white like snow”</b> (Isaiah 1:18). Since the goat is offered to atone for sins, red wool is tied to its horns. The Mishnah cites another allusion. <b>From where</b> is it derived <b>that smearing</b> oil on one’s body <b>is like drinking</b> and is similarly prohibited <b>on Yom Kippur? Although there is no proof for this, there is an allusion to it, as it is stated: “And it comes into his inward parts like water and like oil into his bones”</b> (Psalms 109:18). The verse appears to equate smearing oil on one’s body with drinking water."

          "talmudFullText": "Having cited a dispute with regard to the interpretation of a verse where we are uncertain whether the dispute is between Rav and Shmuel or R' Yoḥanan and R' Elazar, the Talmud cites another verse with regard to which there is a similar dispute. It is said: <b>“Hear Me, stubborn-hearted who are far from charity”</b> (Isaiah 46:12). While both agree that the verse refers to the righteous, <b>Rav and Shmuel, and some say R' Yoḥanan and R' Elazar, </b> disagreed as to how to interpret the verse. <b>One said: The entire world is sustained by</b> God’s <b>charity, </b> not because it deserves to exist, <b>while</b> the righteous who are far from God’s charity <b>are sustained by force, </b> as due to their own good deeds they have the right to demand their sustenance. <b>And one said: The entire world is sustained by the merit</b> of <b>their</b> righteousness, <b>while they are not sustained</b> at all, <b>not even by their own merit, in accordance with</b> the statement that <b>Rav Yehuda</b> said that <b>Rav said. </b>"
