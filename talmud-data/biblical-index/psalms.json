R' Shimon ben Pazi taught: What is the meaning of that which is written: “Happy is the man that has not walked in the counsel of the wicked, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of the scornful” (Psalms 1:1)? Since he did not walk in the counsel of the wicked, how could he stand with them? And since he did not stand, how could he sit with them? And since he did not sit with them, how could he have scorned?  Since he never joined the company of the wicked, he would have no reason to be involved with them in any manner."

Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: The plural is referring to His fingers, as it is written: “When I see Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and stars, which You have established” (Psalms 8:4)."

Let us say that the Mishnah is not in accordance with the opinion of R' Yehuda, as it is taught in a baraita that R' Yehuda says: The harp used in the Temple was an instrument of seven strings, as it is stated: “In your presence is fullness [sova] of joy,  in your right hand sweetness for evermore” (Psalms 16:11). Do not read the word as “fullness [sova]” but as seven [sheva].  This indicates that the “sweet harp” (see Psalms 81:3) played in the presence of God, i.e., in the Temple, has seven strings."

The song of the day for Sunday, which is when the baraita says that the Temple was destroyed, is the psalm beginning with the verse: “A psalm of David. The earth is YHWH’s, and the fullness thereof” (Psalms 24:1). And yet the verse that the baraita says that the Levites were singing: “And He brought upon them their own iniquity, ” is in the song for Wednesday,  not the song for Sunday. Rather, it was merely a portentous lamentation that came into their mouths,  not a song recited over an offering. Consequently, no proof can be offered from this baraita."

The dots that appear over the word luleh in the text indicate doubt and uncertainty of his piety, and whether he was deserving of a place in the land of the living (see Avot DeRabbi Natan 34). In the name of R' Yosei, it was taught in a Tosefta: Why do dots appear over the word luleh,  as if there are some reservations? Because David said before God: God!. I have every confidence in You that You grant an excellent reward to the righteous in the World-to-Come since God’s ultimate goodness is manifest in the land of eternal life, but I still harbor uncertainty with regard to myself, and I do not know whether or not I definitely have a portion among them.

R' Abbahu said:  The source of the mitzva of zimmun is derived from the verse here: “When I call the Name of YHWH, give [plural] praise to our God” (Deuteronomy 32:3)."

Perhaps a king is different,  and excessive worry is appropriate in that case. Rather, proof that one must make oneself ill over a Torah scholar in need for mercy is from here:  When David speaks of his enemies, Doeg and Ahitophel, who were Torah scholars, he says: “But for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth,  I afflicted my soul with fasting” (Psalms 35:13). One must be concerned to the extent that he dresses in sackcloth and fasts for the recovery of a Torah scholar."

It is written here,  with regard to Shabbat: “And I will cause you to ride on the heights [bamotei] of the world” (Isaiah 58:14), and it is written there:  “You are fortunate Israel, who is like you? A nation redeemed by God, the shield that aids you and the sword of your triumph. Your enemies will try to defeat you and you will trample their high places [bamoteimo]” (Deuteronomy 33:29). Rav Yehuda said that Rav said:  With regard to anyone who delights in the Shabbat,  God grants him his heart’s desires,  as it is stated: “And you shall delight in God and He will grant you your heart’s desires” (Psalms 37:4). This delight in God, which is mentioned in the verse, I do not know what it is. When it says: “And you shall call the Shabbat delight, ” one must say: It is the delight of Shabbat.  The Talmud asks: With what does one delight in the day of Shabbat? Rav Yehuda, son of Rav Shmuel bar Sheilat, said in the name of Rav: With a dish of beets, and large fish, and heads of garlic. Rav Ḥiyya bar Ashi said that Rav said: Even with regard to a small item and one prepared it in deference to Shabbat, it is a delight.  The Talmud asks: What is the small item mentioned? Rav Pappa said: Small fried fish. "

Or who has given understanding to the sekhvi” (Job 38:36), which should be understood as follows: “Who has put wisdom in the inward parts”: These are the kidneys that are hidden in the body; “or who has given understanding to the sekhvi”: This is a rooster,  who knows to crow at fixed times during the night."

Subtract two more years for three pregnancies,  one preceding the birth of Eliam the son of Ahithophel, one preceding the birth of Bathsheba, daughter of Eliam, and one preceding the birth of Solomon, son of Bathsheba.

R' Ḥiyya bar Abba said that R' Yoḥanan said: Whoever is lazy in eulogizing a Sage does not live a long life, and his punishment is measure for measure.  Since he was unconcerned with the death of the Sage, in the heavens they will be unconcerned with his death. God conducts Himself in this manner, as it is stated: “In full measure [besase’a], when You send her away You contend with her” (Isaiah 27:8), and the rabbis derived that God punishes from the words: “You contend with her,” and He does so measure for measure, se’a for se’a, from the word sase’a in the verse above."

He said to them: And until Naphtali comes back from the land of Egypt will our father’s father lie in degradation? He took a club [kulepa] and hit Esau on the head,  and Esau’s eyes fell out and they fell on the legs of Jacob. Jacob opened his eyes and smiled. And this is that which is written: “The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked” (Psalms 58:11)."

And further proof that the world was created in Nisan is that when the world was first created, the animals had to breed in order to fill the world, and the period beginning with Nisan is a time when cattle, and beasts, and birds mate with one another, as it is stated: “The flocks are clothed in the meadows,  and the valleys are wrapped in grain; they shout for joy, they also sing” (Psalms 65:14)."

R' Yoḥanan said: And both of them,  R' Meir and R' Elazar, expounded the same verse in different ways. As it is stated in the verse: “The flocks are clothed in the meadows, and the valleys are wrapped in grain; they shout for joy, they also sing” (Psalms 65:14). R' Meir holds: When are the flocks clothed in the meadows,  i.e., when do the rams impregnate the ewes and thereby clothe them? It is at the time when the valleys are wrapped in grain,  i.e., when they are covered in grain. And when are the valleys wrapped in grain?  It is in Adar.  Therefore, the sheep conceive in Adar and give birth five months later in Av,  and so it is fitting that their New Year is on the first of Elul,  as most of the year’s lambs have been born by then."

And when the wind blew upon them, their fruit would fall off, as it is stated: “May his fruits rustle like Lebanon” (Psalms 72:16). And through selling these golden fruits to the public, there was a source of income for the priesthood. "

And that is what Rabba said: What is the meaning of that which is written: “This is the way of them that are foolish and of those who after them speak approvingly, Selah” (Psalms 49:14)? It means that the wicked know that their path leads to eternal death,  but they have fat on their kidneys that prevents that realization from entering their hearts.

R' Yehuda HaNasi said: And do you learn this from here?  Do we need to alter the word for this purpose? Isn’t it already stated explicitly: “And he rained meat upon them like dust, and winged birds like the sand of the seas” (Psalms 78:27)?"

And what song were they singing?  They were singing the verse: “And He brought upon them their own iniquity, and He will cut them off in their own evil” (Psalms 94:23). And they did not manage to recite the end of the verse: “YHWH our God will cut them off, ” before non-Jews came and conquered them. And likewise,  the same happened when the Second Temple was destroyed."

This pertains to the group of cynics, as it is written: “He withdrew His hand with cynics” (Hosea 7:5), indicating that God distanced Himself from them. This pertains to the group of liars, as it is written: “He that speaks falsehoods shall not be established before My eyes” (Psalms 101:7). This pertains to the group of flatterers, as it is written: “That a flatterer shall not come before Him” (Job 13:16).

He clarifies: Upon what does the earth stand? Upon pillars, as it is stated: “Who shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble” (Job 9:6). These pillars are positioned upon water, as it is stated: “To Him Who spread forth the earth over the waters” (Psalms 136:6). These waters stand upon mountains, as it is stated: “The waters stood above the mountains” (Psalms 104:6). The mountains are upon the wind, as it is stated: “For behold He forms the mountains and creates the wind” (Amos 4:13). The wind is upon a storm, as it is stated: “Stormy wind, fulfilling His word” (Psalms 148:8). The storm hangs upon the arm of God as it is stated: “And underneath are the everlasting arms” (Deuteronomy 33:27), which demonstrates that the entire world rests upon the arms of God."

Over the course of many generations, extending many years after the talmudic period, the book that is today named for Nehemiah was not a separate book and was included in the book of Ezra. R' Yirmeya bar Abba says:  The book was not named for Nehemiah because he took credit for himself and boasted about his good deeds, as it is stated: “Remember me, God, for good” (Nehemiah 13:31). The Talmud asks: Is that a shortcoming? King David also said: “Remember me, Lord, when You show favor to Your people; visit me with Your salvation” (Psalms 106:4).

The Talmud explains: Here,  where the verse says that God’s mercy is above the heavens, it is referring to a case where one performs a mitzva for its own sake; and here,  where the verse says that God’s mercy reaches the heavens, it is referring to a case where one performs a mitzva not for its own sake.  Even a mitzva performed with ulterior motives garners reward, as Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: A person should always engage in Torah study and performance of mitzvot, even if he does so not for their own sake, as through the performance of mitzvot not for their own sake,  one gains understanding and comes to perform them for their own sake.

From where is it derived that a woman who discharges semen even on the 3rd day after sex is ritually impure,  just like one who touches semen (see Leviticus 15:17)? Because the semen remains fit for insemination, it can transmit impurity, as it is stated prior to the revelation at Sinai: “And he said to the people, prepare yourselves for three days,  do not approach a woman” (Exodus 19:15). This three-day separation period ensured that even a woman who discharged semen would be pure. The Mishnah cites another halakha based on a biblical allusion: From where is it derived that one may wash the circumcision on the 3rd day,  meaning the 3rd day after the circumcision, even if it occurs on Shabbat? As it is stated: “And it came to pass on the 3rd day when they were in pain” (Genesis 34:25). The pain of circumcision lasts at least three days, and as long as the child is in pain he is considered to be in danger. The Mishnah cites another halakha with an allusion in the Bible: From where is it derived that one ties a scarlet strip of wool to the head of the scapegoat that is dispatched to Azazel? As it is stated: “If your sins be like scarlet, they will become white like snow” (Isaiah 1:18). Since the goat is offered to atone for sins, red wool is tied to its horns. The Mishnah cites another allusion. From where is it derived that smearing oil on one’s body is like drinking and is similarly prohibited on Yom Kippur? Although there is no proof for this, there is an allusion to it, as it is stated: “And it comes into his inward parts like water and like oil into his bones” (Psalms 109:18). The verse appears to equate smearing oil on one’s body with drinking water."

          "talmudFullText": "We have found proof that abstaining from smearing oil on oneself is considered affliction; from where do we derive that abstaining from bathing is also called affliction? Rav Zutra ben Toviya, said: The verse states: “And it came into his innards like water, and like oil into his bones” (Psalms 109:18). This means that the water with which one bathes and the oil with which one smears himself are absorbed into the body. Just as abstaining from smearing oil is considered an affliction, so too, abstaining from bathing is considered an affliction. The Talmud objects: But say that “came into his innards like water” is referring to drinking rather than smearing oil. The Talmud rejects this: It is similar to oil. Just as the oil described in the verse is smeared from outside the body and not drunk, so too,  the water mentioned in the verse is used for bathing from the outside.  It is not drunk."

Therefore, the phrase “and it came into his innards like water” is referring to the act of drinking water. Rather, Rav Ashi said: Bathing is derived from the same verse cited above, as it is written: “Neither did I anoint myself at all” (Daniel 10:3). This teaches that Daniel did not do any anointing, including bathing. Consequently, the same source prohibits both of these activities."

In reciting hallel there are allusions to several halakhic matters and customs that the rabbis instituted due to circumstances extant at the time. Although due to increased literacy and familiarity with the hallel liturgy the reasons no longer apply, these customs remain in practice. The prayer leader recites: “Halleluya” (Psalms 113:1), and the congregation recites: Halleluya,  in response. From here is the source that there is a mitzva to respond: Halleluya. "

The fact is that there is no marriage contract and wedding in which contentiousness does not arise,  as there is inevitably some conflict between the parties.

Some say that one who sees an olive tree in a dream,  it is a sign that a good reputation will spread for him, as it is stated:  “YHWH called your name a leafy olive tree, fair with goodly fruit” (Jeremiah 11:16). One who sees olive oil in a dream should anticipate the light of Torah, as it is stated: “That they bring unto you pure olive oil beaten for the light” (Exodus 27:20). One who sees palm trees [temarim] in a dream has seen a sign that his transgressions have ceased, as it is stated: “Your iniquity is finished, O daughter of Zion” (Lamentations 4:22), as the Talmud likens temara, date, to tam ra, evil has ceased."

Rav and Shmuel disagree over the meaning of the word tzela: One said:  It means a female face,  from which God created Eve; and one said:  Adam was created with a tail [zanav],  which God removed from him and from which He created Eve."

The attribute of flesh and blood is that when a person plants seeds of different species in one garden bed, each and every one of the seeds emerges as a grown plant according to its species. But God forms the fetus in a woman’s womb, and all of the seeds, i.e., those of both the father and the mother, emerge when the offspring is formed as one sex."
