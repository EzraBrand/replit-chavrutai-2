Isn’t it written: “Like vinegar to the teeth, and like smoke to the eyes, </b> so is the lazy one to those who send him” (Proverbs 10:26)? The Talmud answers: This is <b>not difficult, </b> as there is a distinction. <b>This</b> verse, which indicates that vinegar is harmful for teeth, is referring <b>to fruit vinegar. The</b> Mishnah, which indicates that vinegar is beneficial for teeth, is referring <b>to</b> wine <b>vinegar.

One flays the rest of the animal after Shabbat. Further skinning is only to facilitate eating the animal, therefore, it does not override Shabbat; this is <b>the statement of R' Yishmael ben Yoḥanan ben Beroka. And the Rabbis say: One flays it in its entirety. </b> The Talmud asks: <b>Granted, according to</b> the opinion of <b>R' Yishmael ben Yoḥanan ben Beroka, </b> who said one may flay only part of the animal, the <i>halakha</i> is understandable. <b>Since it has</b> already <b>been used for its divine purpose</b> of having its blood sprinkled on the altar, the animal no longer should be flayed. <b>But according to the Rabbis, what is the reason</b> for their opinion? <b>Rabba bar bar Ḥana said</b> that <b>R' Yoḥanan said: The verse states, “All that YHWH has made is for His sake”</b> (Proverbs 16:4), meaning that a prohibited action is only permitted if its performance honors God. The Talmud asks: <b>And here, what</b> manifestation of <b>for His sake is there</b> in flaying the remaining hide from the Paschal lamb? <b>Rav Yosef said: </b> The Rabbis permitted removing the entire hide so <b>that</b> the sacrifice <b>will not putrefy. Rava said: </b> The Rabbis permitted removing the entire hide so <b>that the sacred sacrifices will not be left</b> in disgrace <b>like</b> a half-stripped <b>animal carcass</b> left unattended."
