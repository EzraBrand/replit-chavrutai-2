And nevertheless, this is not difficult. This,  which says that it is a mitzva to confront them, is referring to a completely righteous person, while this,  which says that one may not confront the wicked, is referring to one who is not completely righteous, as Rav Huna said: What is the meaning of that which is written: “Why do You look on those who deal treacherously and hold Your peace? When the wicked swallows the man more righteous than he? ” (Habakkuk 1:13). This verse is difficult to understand. Do the wicked swallow the righteous? Isn’t it written:  “The wicked looks to the righteous and seeks to kill him; YHWH will not leave him in his hand,  nor allow him to be condemned when he is judged” (Psalms 37:32–33), and it is written: “No mischief shall befall the righteous” (Proverbs 12:21)? Rather,  in light of these verses, the verse: “The wicked swallows the man more righteous than he” means: The man who is more righteous than he,  but not completely righteous, he swallows. The completely righteous he does not swallow. "

Why are people compared to the fish of the sea?  This serves to say to you: Just as with regard to the fish of the sea, once they arise onto dry land they die immediately; so too,  with regard to people, once they separate themselves from studying words of Torah and performing the mitzvot, they die immediately. Alternatively, just as with regard to the fish of the sea, once the sun is heated over them they die immediately, so too with regard to people, once the sun is heated over them they die immediately.

          "talmudFullText": "The Talmud concludes the tractate with a general statement with regard to Torah study. The school of Elijah taught: Anyone who studies halakhot every day is guaranteed that he is destined for the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “His ways [halikhot] are eternal” (Habakkuk 3:6). Do not read the verse as halikhot; rather,  read it as halakhot.  The verse indicates that the study of halakhot brings one to eternal life in the future world."

The Talmud is puzzled by this statement: Could it enter your mind that they are individuals who erode the world? Ravina says:  This statement is referring to those who issue halakhic rulings based on their knowledge of mishnayot. This is also taught in a baraita: R' Yehoshua said: Are they individuals who erode the world? Aren’t they settling the world, as it is stated: “His ways [halikhot] are eternal” (Habakkuk 3:6)? The rabbis read the term halikhot as halakhot, inferring that one who learns halakhot attains eternal life. Rather,  this is referring to those who issue halakhic rulings based on their knowledge of mishnayot. "

Rava said to himself: What is this,  why is today different? He went up to the roof to think about it. He heard a child say the verse: “When I heard, my innards trembled,  my lips quivered at the voice, rottenness enters into my bones, and I tremble where I stand; that I should wait for the day of trouble when he comes up against the people that he invades” (Habakkuk 3:16). Rava said: Learn from this that Rav Ḥisda has died.  I am therefore not worthy to receive the quail anymore, since it is on account of the teacher that the student eats.  When Rav Ḥisda was alive, Rava received the quail due to Rav Ḥisda’s merit; now that he had died, Rava was not worthy to receive the quail."
