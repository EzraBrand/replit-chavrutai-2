R' Yoḥanan says: And that is the case only where he spits into the wound while he whispers, as one does not mention the name of Heaven over spittle,  and doing so is an act of contempt for God. It was stated that Rav says: Even the verse: “When a leprous mark is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest” (Leviticus 13:9), in which there is no mention of the name of God, may not be whispered as an invocation. R' Ḥanina says: Even a verse that is unrelated to the specific illness in question, for example: “And He called to Moses” (Leviticus 1:1), may not be whispered as an invocation."

Why does the verse mention calling before speaking,  and God did not speak to him at the outset? The Torah is teaching etiquette: A person should not say anything to another unless he calls him first. This supports the opinion of R' Ḥanina, as R' Ḥanina said: A person should not say anything to another unless he calls him first. With regard to the term concluding the verse: “Saying, ” R' Musya, grandson of R' Masya, said in the name of R' Musya the Great: From where is it derived with regard to one who tells another some matter, that it is incumbent upon the latter not to say it to others until the former explicitly says to him: Go and tell others? As it is stated: “And YHWH spoke to him from within the Tent of Meeting, saying [lemor]. ” Lemor is a contraction of lo emor, meaning: Do not say. One must be given permission before transmitting information."

The tanna infers: “Of you, ” indicating: But not all of you.  This serves to exclude the transgressor,  from whom an offering is not accepted. The tanna continues: The term “of you” is also interpreted to mean that I distinguished among you and not among the nations.  Therefore, a non-Jew may bring an offering even if he is an idol worshipper. The expression “from the animal” serves to include people who are similar to an animal in that they do not recognize God. From here,  the rabbis stated: One accepts offerings from Jewish transgressors so that they will consequently repent, except for the transgressor, one who pours wine as a libation to idolatry, and one who desecrates Shabbat in public [befarhesya].

When it states later,  in the next verse: “If his offering is a burnt offering of the herd” (Leviticus 1:3), this is difficult, as there is no need for the verse to state this, as it was already written earlier.

To counter this, the verse states: “Of the herd or of the flock, ” separating the two types with the word “or,” thereby indicating that if he wanted to bring one of them, he may bring just one, and if he wanted to bring two,  he may bring two.

The verse states: “An offering to YHWH” (Leviticus 1:2).

However, after the despair of the owner, didn’t the robber acquire the animal with the despair?  Once the owner despairs, the animal belongs to the robber, despite the fact that he incurs a debt that he must repay the owner. Since the animal is legally his, why is it prohibited for the robber to sacrifice it as an offering? Rather, is it not because the offering is a mitzva that comes by means of a transgression?  Since the animal came into his possession by means of a transgression, it is unfit for use in fulfilling a mitzva."

This seems to prove that consent resulting from coercion is considered to be valid consent. Perhaps this principle can apply to acquisition, as a source for Rav Huna’s ruling."

The Talmud asks: From where does one ascertain that this term, ḥattehu, is an expression of purification?  The Talmud answers: It is ascertained from a verse, as it is written: “And he shall purify [veḥitte] the house” (Leviticus 14:52).

Since it is stated about doves: “And he shall sacrifice his offering of doves” (Leviticus 1:14), in the plural, I might derive from here that the one who says: It is incumbent upon me to bring a bird as a burnt offering, shall not bring less than two young birds.  Therefore, the verse states: “And the priest shall sacrifice it” (Leviticus 1:15), in the singular, to teach that one may bring a gift offering of even one single young bird.

Rather,  this comes to include that one who detaches after one who cuts is liable.  Apparently, one is liable for sterilizing one who is already castrated. Rather,  we must say that it is permitted to use a remedy that causes sterility in an old man who is no longer capable of procreating."

As the Rabbis hold that the sanctity of the Sanctuary is discrete and the sanctity of the Entrance Hall is discrete,  i.e., the Sanctuary and the Entrance Hall have distinct levels of sanctity. And since the essence of the Temple is the Sanctuary and not the Entrance Hall, and since the Sanctuary in the Temple parallels the Tent of Meeting in the Tabernacle, when the verse speaks of the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, it is referring to the doorway of the Sanctuary.

The Talmud elaborates: R' Yoḥanan said it is prohibited by Torah law because it is fit to combine with another half-measure. If one continues to eat more, he will eat a whole measure, which is punishable by Torah law. Therefore, even when he eats the first half-measure he is eating forbidden food. Reish Lakish said it is permitted by Torah law. His reason is as follows: With regard to all forbidden foods, God states in the Torah: “Eat, ” for example in the verse: “You shall eat neither fat nor blood” (Leviticus 3:17).

The expression “me’aḥat mehena” is interpreted in several ways. One of them is: There is an instance of “them [hena], ” i.e., many unwitting transgressions, which is like “one [aḥat], ” a single unwitting transgression, in that one is liable to bring only one sin offering. How so? When one performed many labors where his action was unwitting with regard to Shabbat but his action was intentional with regard to the prohibited labors,  he brings only one sin offering. That is the case referred to in the Mishnah."

R' Yosei interprets the verse that at times one is liable to bring one sin-offering for all of his transgressions, and at times one is liable to bring a sin-offering for each and every transgression. And R' Yosei ben Ḥanina, said: What is the rationale for the opinion of R' Yosei?  He interprets the unique phrase employed in that verse: From one of these. The Torah could have merely stated: One [aḥat].  Instead, it stated: From one [me’aḥat].  It could have merely stated: Them [hena].  Instead, it stated: Of them [me’hena].  R' Yosei derives that there are cases of one transgression that,  with regard to punishment, are them,  i.e., many.

When this principle is employed, the halakha written in one context is viewed as if it were written elsewhere. In this case, as it was not necessary for the verse to write the juxtaposition to a peace offering in the context of the sin offering brought by the High Priest, it is applied to the case of the bull for an unwitting communal sin.

How so? If the court said: There is no prohibition against having sex with a menstruating woman written in the Torah,  or there is no prohibition against performing prohibited labor on Shabbat written in the Torah,  or there is no prohibition against engaging in idol worship written in the Torah,  one might have thought that the judges would be liable.

The verse states: “And the Elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock” (Leviticus 4:15). The term: “Shall lay their hands, ” which is in the plural, indicates that there are two,  and the word “Elders, ” which is also plural, indicates another two,  meaning a total of four. And since a court may not be composed of an even number of judges, we add another one to them,  and there are five judges here.  Consequently, R' Yehuda does accept the halakha that a court may not be composed of an even number of judges."

This offering is brought by “the Elders of the congregation” (Leviticus 4:15).

If even other priests cannot perform it, certainly women cannot.

This can be explained by a parable:  It can be compared to a flesh-and-blood king against whom a province sinned. If a minority of that province sinned,  his relationship with his entourage [pamalya] remains,  i.e., the king continues to treat his loyal followers in the usual manner. But if the majority of the province sinned,  his relationship with his entourage does not remain,  and he no longer meets even those who remained devoted to him. Similarly, when the entire people sins, God no longer has the same relationship with them, and it is as though the place where the priest sprinkles the blood is no longer sacred."

The verse’s emphasis on the words “when he does it” means: One who does all of it,  i.e., the entire transgression, is liable and not one who does part of it.  Therefore, an individual, and he performed an action in its entirety, is liable.  However, two people, and they performed an action together, are not liable,  as each one performed only part of the action. The Talmud comments: It was also stated in support of R' Yehuda HaNasi’s opinion: R' Ḥiyya bar Gamda said:  Amidst a discussion of these matters, it emanated from the group of rabbis and they said:  From the verse’s emphasis on “when he does it” it is derived: An individual who performed it is liable.

It comes to exclude an apostate.  When an apostate sins unwittingly, he is under no obligation to bring a sin-offering even after he repents. R' Shimon ben Elazar says in the name of R' Shimon:  This halakha is derived from the phrase in that verse: “That may not be done, and he becomes guilty. ” One who repents due to his awareness,  i.e., one who repents as soon as he becomes aware that he performed a transgression, brings a sacrifice for his unwitting transgression. However, one who does not repent due to his awareness that he sinned, e.g., an apostate who continues to sin even after he becomes aware that he committed a transgression, does not bring an offering for his unwitting action.

It is written: “And if one person among the common people sins unwittingly by performing it,  any one of God’s commandments not to be done, and be guilty” (Leviticus 4:27). The Talmud interpreted: “By performing it,” means that one who performs a transgression in its entirety is liable, and not one who performs part of it. How so?  If two people were holding a pitchfork and gathering the stalks, or holding a shuttle and weaving the threads of the warp, or holding a quill and writing,  or holding a reed and carrying it out to the public domain,  I might have thought they are liable,  therefore the verse states: “By performing it. ” One who performs a transgression in its entirety is liable, and not one who performs only part of it.

R' Shimon holds: Three exclusionary statements are written in this verse. It is as if it were written: A person who sins, one who sins,  and by performing it he sins.  The Torah could have conveyed the same meaning by saying simply: And if one of the common people. Apparently, the superfluous words in the verse are exclusionary and the verse should be understood as follows: A person, and not many people; one, and not two; by performing it, and not by two performing it. One of the terms comes to exclude from liability a case where each of the two people performs a part of the transgression, i.e., this person lifts an object from one domain, and that person places it in another domain. And one of the terms comes to exclude a case where this person is capable of performing the action alone, and that person is also capable,  and the two of them perform the action together.

R' Zeira said:  The reason is that if one dies before his sin becomes known to him, he dies without iniquity. Rava objects to this claim: If he dies, death itself absolves him, and therefore there is no need for a provisional guilt offering.

Therefore,  in the case where one of two women ate forbidden fat, they do not bring a sin offering together and stipulate that it should be for whichever of them ate the forbidden fat.

Therefore, the verse opens with a restriction, and when the verse continues, and it is written “through which, ” which is also a restriction,  this constitutes a restriction after a restriction, and a restriction after a restriction serves only to amplify the halakha, applying it to additional cases."

But isn’t it taught in a baraita: One might have thought that if one takes an oath to do evil to himself and did not do evil he will be exempt from bringing an offering for having transgressed this oath. Therefore, the verse states:  “Or if anyone swear clearly with his lips to do evil or to do good” (Leviticus 5:4), which teaches that just as taking an oath to do good for which one is liable is referring to an optional activity, as opposed to taking an oath to perform a mitzva, so too,  taking an oath to do evil is referring to an optional activity, as opposed to taking an oath to transgress. I can therefore include within the category of one who is liable if he transgressed his oath the person who takes an oath to do evil to himself and did not do evil. It is clear from this baraita that doing evil to oneself is permitted."

The Talmud infers: The liability to bring an offering for taking a false oath applies only to one who takes an oath on his own initiative, but not when the oath is administered by others.

By contrast, with regard to a wealthy person who brings a lamb as a sliding-scale offering, the verse states: “And the priest shall effect atonement for him from his sin [al ḥattato] that he has sinned” (Leviticus 5:6). The word “al,” which can also mean on, indicates that if an extremely destitute individual designates a 10th of an ephah for his meal offering and then becomes wealthy, he redeems his meal offering and adds money on to the original sum in order to purchase an offering that is appropriate for his current financial status. In that case, the meal offering is redeemed even if it is pure."

And it is known that a lamb is brought when it is within its first year, as it is written: “A lamb of the first year” (Leviticus 12:6).

And as for what is difficult with this case, namely that the double payment is four dinars and the additional one-5th is one dinar,  this problem can be resolved as follows: With what are we dealing here?  It is a case where the bailee took an oath that the deposit was stolen from him, and he again took the same oath,  and so on four times, and after each oath he admitted afterward that he had lied. And the Torah said: “And shall add its 5th part [ḥamishitav] to it” (Leviticus 5:24)."

It is as the verse states concerning, among others, one who misappropriated a deposit: “To whom it appertains shall he give it on the day of his being guilty” (Leviticus 5:24).

And,  with regard to all sacrifices, such as the sin-offerings and the guilt-offerings that are eaten for one day and night; although the rabbis state that they may be eaten only until midnight, by Torah law they may be eaten until dawn.  This is in accordance with the verse: “On the day on which it is offered must you eat. Do not leave it until the morning” (Leviticus 7:15). If so, why did the rabbis say that they may be eaten only until midnight?  This is in order to distance a person from transgression,  as if one believes that he has until dawn to perform the mitzva, he might be negligent and postpone it until the opportunity to perform the mitzva has passed."

Do we derive it from the teruma of the tithe,  the portion that the Levite sets aside for the priest, in which case one hundredth of the total is separated, or do we derive it from the donations that were set aside from the spoils of the war with Midian, where one five-hundredth was taken from the spoils of war (see Numbers 31:28)? Come and hear a teaching with regard to this dilemma. As R' Ḥiyya taught in a baraita that it is stated here: “And he shall take up the ashes” (Leviticus 6:3), and it is said elsewhere,  with regard to a meal-offering: “And he shall take up a handful of the choice flour of the meal-offering” (Leviticus 6:8). Just as there,  the amount he removes is a handful of flour, so too, here,  he removes a handful of ash. The amount of ashes removed from the altar is therefore not a fixed percentage of the total ash."

Come and hear a teaching with regard to this dilemma. As R' Ḥiyya taught in a baraita that it is stated here: “And he shall take up the ashes” (Leviticus 6:3), and it is said elsewhere,  with regard to a meal-offering: “And he shall take up a handful of the choice flour of the meal-offering” (Leviticus 6:8). Just as there,  the amount he removes is a handful of flour, so too, here,  he removes a handful of ash. The amount of ashes removed from the altar is therefore not a fixed percentage of the total ash."

The Talmud answers: The Mishnah’s statement pertains to the matter of scouring and rinsing copper vessels in which a sin offering was cooked (see Leviticus 6:21), which is relevant only to sin offerings that are eaten. But in the matter of laundering:  “You shall launder that on which it shall be sprinkled” (Leviticus 6:20) is written,  and the term “it shall be sprinkled” indicates only internal sin offerings. By contrast, eaten sin offerings are included only through the amplification in the verse: “The law of the sin offering” (Leviticus 6:18)."

Let the verse write: “It shall be burnt with fire, ” and it will not need to write: “Shall not be eaten. ” For what purpose then does the verse state: “It shall not be eaten”? If it does not apply to the subject matter itself, as that was already derived from the statement of R' Elazar that whatever has been rendered disqualified in the sacred place may not be eaten, apply it to all other prohibitions in the Torah,  including leavened bread on Passover and a stoned ox. And if it does not apply to the prohibition against eating,  which is written explicitly, then apply it to the prohibition of deriving benefit. "

This first baraita is in accordance with the opinion of R' Eliezer, and that second baraita is in accordance with the opinion of the Rabbis.  He explains: R' Eliezer is the tanna who juxtaposes the guilt offering to a sin offering,  teaching that just as a sin offering is disqualified when sacrificed not for its sake, so too, the guilt offering, such as the metzora’s guilt offering, is disqualified when sacrificed not for its sake, as it is written: “As is the sin offering, so is the guilt offering; there is one law for them” (Leviticus 7:7). He also juxtaposes the log of oil of the metzora to the guilt offering of the metzora in the same verse, teaching that if the sprinkling from the log of oil was performed not for its own sake, it is not valid. In contrast, the Rabbis do not juxtapose the guilt offering to the sin offering, and therefore they have no reason to invalidate the sprinkling from the metzora’s log of oil that is performed not for its own sake."

As A baraita states:  The verse states with regard to the loaves accompanying the thanks offering: “With cakes of leavened bread he shall present his offering with the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanks” (Leviticus 7:13). This teaches that the loaves are not consecrated unless the surface of the loaves formed a crust in the oven,  as only then can they be considered “cakes of leavened bread. ” The phrase “he shall present his offering with the sacrifice” teaches that the loaves are consecrated only upon the slaughtering of the offering.  The phrase “the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanks” teaches that if one slaughtered the offering not for its sake, the loaves were not consecrated. "

The Talmud asks: It is obvious that this is the case, as here,  with regard to matza, “bread” is written, and there,  with regard to the loaves of the thanks-offering, “bread” is also written (Leviticus 7:13). Since both loaves are called bread, it is obvious that the same criteria should apply to both cases."

And we have learned that ten-tenths of an ephah is required for the ten loaves of leavened bread. From where is it derived that ten-tenths of an ephah are required for the matza which also accompanies a thanks offering? After stating that thirty matzot accompany a thanks offering, the verse states: “With cakes of leavened bread” (Leviticus 7:13), to juxtapose the matza with the leavened bread. This teaches that one must bring matza of an amount corresponding to the leavened bread.

Rav Zevid said to Rav Mari: With regard to your claim, the verse states concerning forbidden fat: “You shall eat no fat of ox, or sheep, or goat” (Leviticus 7:23). This teaches that for the prohibition against eating forbidden fat to take effect we require an item that is found equally in all three types of animals, an ox, and a sheep, and a goat, and that is not the case here. Since an ox and goat do not have tails, the tail is not prohibited even in the case of a sheep."

Rav Minyomi bar Ḥilkiya said that R' Maḥseya bar Idi said that R' Yoḥanan said they are derived from Aaron and his sons, who remained in the Tabernacle for seven days prior to performing the service in the Tabernacle on the 8th day of their inauguration, as the verse states: “As has been done this day, so YHWH has commanded to do, to make atonement for you” (Leviticus 8:34), meaning that this mitzva of sequestering was not limited to the days prior to the dedication of the Tabernacle; rather, it applies to future generations as well. The verse is interpreted homiletically: “To do”; these are the actions performed in the burning of the red heifer for which the priest performing the ritual is sequestered seven days in advance; “to make atonement”; these are the actions performed on Yom Kippur,  before which the High Priest is sequestered seven days."

Rav Mesharshiyya said in rejection of this challenge: No,  there is no a fortiori inference here, as the verse: “As has been done this day, so YHWH has commanded to do, to make atonement for you” (Leviticus 8:34), is written to emphasize specifically a day like this day; precisely as it was for the inauguration, and not in any other situation."

What does this repetition teach? From the phrase: “For so I am commanded, ” it is derived that even in a state of acute mourning,  on the first day after the death of a relative, one must eat the offering. God stated the verse: “As I commanded, ” at the time of the incident just after the deaths of Nadav and Avihu, when Aaron and his sons were in a state of acute mourning.

God stated the verse: “As I commanded, ” at the time of the incident just after the deaths of Nadav and Avihu, when Aaron and his sons were in a state of acute mourning. And when Moses states: “As God commanded, ” he is saying: The command is from God and it is not from my own initiative that I am saying it."

This is because it is a wooden vessel designated to rest in a fixed place, and the halakha is that any large, wooden vessel designated to rest in a fixed place cannot become impure. What is the reason for this halakha? Since wooden vessels and sacks are juxtaposed in the verse describing their impurity (Leviticus 11:32), we require a wooden vessel to be similar to a sack in order to be capable of contracting impurity, in the following manner: Just as a sack is carried when it is both full and empty, so too any wooden vessel that is carried full and empty can contract impurity, as opposed to vessels, such as the table, that are designated to rest in a fixed place.

So too, it is taught in a baraita with regard to creeping animals like this case:  One might have thought that flesh that separates from a creeping animal during its lifetime should be impure like a creeping animal carcass. Therefore, the verse states with regard to creeping animal carcasses: “And upon whatever any of them falls when they are dead shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:32). The word “dead” teaches that just as death does not generate a replacement, so too any element of a creeping animal that dies and does not generate a replacement imparts the impurity of a creeping animal carcass, excluding flesh; this is the statement of R' Yosei HaGelili.

As it is written with regard to the eight species of impure creeping animals: “And anything that these fall upon, when they are dead, it shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:32). What does the term “when they are dead” serve to exclude? If we say it serves to exclude the time when they are alive,  that principle is derived from:  “And everything upon which any part of their carcass falls shall be impure” (Leviticus 11:35), which explicitly states that only their carcasses impart impurity. Rather, learn from the verse that death renders a hanging limb as though it had already fallen off,  and slaughter does not render a hanging limb as though it had already fallen off. "

Just as a sack is carried both when it is full and when it is empty, so too, any wooden vessel that is carried both full and empty is susceptible to impurity.

As it was taught in a baraita: From the use of the word hide, I have derived nothing other than the fact that the hide of a kosher animal becomes ritually impure from contact with a creeping animal; however, from where is it derived that the hide of a non-kosher animal can become ritually impure? This is derived from the amplification, as the verse states: Or hide.  Since, with regard to the ritual impurity of creeping animals the laws of the hides of kosher and non-kosher animals are identical, it is derived that this is also true with regard to the halakhot of ritual impurity imparted by a corpse. Once again, the Talmud says: There is room to refute this derivation and say: What is the comparison to creeping animals,  as their legal status is stringent because they become ritually impure even if they are as small as a lentil-bulk,  which is not true in the case of a corpse? In order for a corpse to transmit ritual impurity, it must be larger, an olive-bulk. Therefore, the Talmud says: If so, the case of tzara'at can prove that the fact that creeping animals that are a lentil-bulk transmit impurity is not a factor in whether or not a non-kosher animal hide can become ritually impure. tzara'at that is a lentil-bulk does not transmit impurity and, nevertheless, the hide of a non-kosher animal becomes ritually impure from it. And the derivation has reverted to its starting point. The aspect of this case is not like the aspect of that case and the aspect of that case is not like the aspect of this case, as each case has its own unique stringencies. However, their common denominator is that hide,  in general, is ritually impure in both cases, and the Torah rendered the hide of a non-kosher animal equal to the hide of a kosher animal in that it becomes ritually impure. I will also bring the additional halakha of a tent over a corpse made of the hide of a non-kosher animal, and in that case as well, the hide of a non-kosher animal will be rendered equal to the hide of a kosher animal.

He said to him: With regard to all matters of halakha, R' Shimon equates the status of a perforated pot with that of being detached.  However, the matter of impurity is different, as the Torah amplified purity with regard to seeds, as it is stated:  “And if anything falls from their carcasses upon any sowing seed that is sown,  it is pure” (Leviticus 11:37). The repetitive language: “Any sowing seed that is sown” teaches that any seed that can be characterized as sowing, including one growing in a perforated pot, remains pure.

It was asked with regard to this derivation: Say that this verse teaches that a handle exports impurity but not that it imports impurity. The Talmud suggests: That question is not difficult. From the outset, when the halakha of a handle is written:  “But if water is put upon the seed, and any of their carcass falls on it, it is impure for you” (Leviticus 11:38), it is written in the context of importing impurity. Therefore, it is inferred a fortiori that a handle exports impurity from the halakha that it imports impurity, and it is derived a fortiori from the halakhot of a handle that protection both imports and exports impurity. It is also derived that protection joins together with the food to constitute the requisite measure to impart impurity from that which is written: “On any sowing seed. ”"

The verse is interpreted as coming to include offspring of eight months. Large domesticated animals typically give birth after a gestation period of nine months. If an animal of that sort gives birth after eight months, its offspring is deemed to be not viable and its slaughter does not purify it.  Rather, it assumes the status of an unslaughtered animal, which is not only prohibited to be eaten, but also transmits ritual impurity to those who touch or move it. R' Yosei ben Yehuda, and R' Elazar ben Shimon, say: Its slaughter purifies it,  and it does not assume unslaughtered animal status."

From here it is derived that with regard to impurity transmitted by carrying we require that one carry [nosei] the requisite measure of impurity of a carcass, i.e., an olive-bulk, and that that olive-bulk be capable of being carried [nissa] all at once,  without the assistance of a utensil.

R' Yitzḥak bar Avudimi says:  In the passage dealing with the impurity of creeping animals and the prohibition of eating them it is written: “With any swarming thing that swarms” (Leviticus 11:43), indicating that a carcass of a creeping animal renders items impure in any place where it swarms. And it is written:  “All swarming things that swarm upon the earth” (Leviticus 11:42), indicating that it transmits impurity only if it is on the earth. How so?  How can one reconcile these two verses? Definite contact with it renders one impure;  one who has uncertain contact with it,  e.g., the impurity is floating, remains pure. "

And there is precedent for such an explanation, as didn’t Abaye say with regard to a parallel case: If one ate a small water creature [putita], he is flogged with four sets of lashes because one violates four prohibitions when eating such a creature? Two of these prohibitions are found in the verse that discusses all types of creeping animals: “You shall not make yourselves detestable with any swarming thing that swarms, neither shall you make yourselves impure with them, that you should be defiled by them” (Leviticus 11:43). A 3rd prohibition applies to creeping animals that live in the water, as the verses say: “And all that have neither fins nor scales…They shall be a detestable thing unto you; you shall not eat of their flesh” (Leviticus 11:10–11). A 4th prohibition is cited in the verse: “And whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat; it is impure unto you” (Deuteronomy 14:10)."

And the Talmud asks: If so,  it should also be prohibited to give a child a kosher locust,  lest the child will eat it, as the Talmud related that Rav Kahana stood before Rav and passed a live kosher locust near his mouth.  Rav said to Rav Kahana: Put it down,  so that people will not mistakenly say: He is eating it and violating the prohibition of “You shall not make yourselves detestable” (Leviticus 11:43). Apparently, eating a kosher locust is prohibited while it is alive. Rather,  even according to the unattributed Mishnah, there is no room for concern that a young child will eat a locust with which he is playing. The reason that the first tanna prohibits giving a non-kosher locust to a child for play is the concern that perhaps it will die and he will eat it. And R' Yehuda,  who permits giving a non-kosher locust to a child for play, does not share that concern. If the locust dies,  the child will eulogize it and mourn its death, and certainly would not eat it."

From this verse I have derived only that the children of Israel are included in this halakha; from where do I derive that a convert and an emancipated female slave are also included? Therefore, the verse states: “A woman, ” which includes other women. And if it enters your mind that the verse is speaking of teruma, are a convert and a female slave eligible to eat teruma?

Alternatively, and from where do we know that the reason the Temple service does not override the prohibition of tzara'at is specifically because tzara'at is more stringent than the Temple service? Perhaps the Temple service does not override the prohibition of tzara'at because a man afflicted with tzara'at is unfit to perform the Temple service and not due to the stringency of the prohibition to remove symptoms of tzara'at from one’s body. And if so, how do I establish the verse: “And on the 8th day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised” (Leviticus 12:3)? That it applies to days other than Shabbat.

How so? Here,  in the first verse, it is referring to teruma; there,  in the second verse, it is referring to sacrificial food.  A woman following childbirth falls into the category of one who lacks atonement, but nevertheless the verse teaches that if she has immersed, she may eat teruma after sunset. The same is true of a confirmed metzora and all others who lack atonement."

Isn’t it taught in a baraita: The section dealing with a woman following childbirth opens with the verse: “Speak to the children of Israel,  saying: If a woman delivers and bears a male, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of the impurity of her menstrual affliction shall she be unclean” (Leviticus 12:2). From this verse I have derived only that the children of Israel are included in this halakha; from where do I derive that a convert and an emancipated female slave are also included? Therefore, the verse states: “A woman, ” which includes other women. And if it enters your mind that the verse is speaking of teruma, are a convert and a female slave eligible to eat teruma?  It is prohibited for them to marry priests, so there can be no possibility of their eating teruma."

And it is known that a lamb is brought when it is within its first year, as it is written: “A lamb of the first year” (Leviticus 12:6). And we learned in a Mishnah (8a): The price of nests,  i.e., pairs of birds brought by an impoverished person instead of a lamb, stood that day at one-quarter of a silver dinar. A quarter-dinar is one-sixteenth of a sela, the price of a lamb."

And could this not be derived through logical inference:  The Torah deemed one impure in the case of a zav, and the Torah deemed one impure in the case of leprous marks.

This is like the appearance of an area illuminated by the sun, which appears deeper than the area in the shade.  The darker shade of a se’et makes it appear as though it is raised above the surrounding skin; this is indicated by the fact that the word se’et means nothing other than raised, and so the verse states: “Upon all the high mountains and upon all the raised up [hanissaot] hills” (Isaiah 2:14). The words hanissaot and se’et share the same Hebrew root and both refer to something raised up. In the verse: “For a se’et and for a sappaḥat” (Leviticus 14:56), the word sappaḥat means nothing other than secondary, and so the verse states: “And he will say: Append me [sefaḥeni] please to one of the priestly classes to eat a piece of bread” (I Samuel 2:36).

The metzora must inform others of his status so that they know not to come into contact with him and thereby maintain their ritual purity.

And similarly, R' Uzziel, grandson of R' Uzziel the Great, said: Impurity cries out to the passerby and tells him: Remove yourself. "

The verse could have simply stated: Or hide,  and it said instead: Or in a hide.  The rabbis said: These words, or in a hide, amplify to include the hide of a non-kosher animal as well as hide that was afflicted in the hands of a priest,  i.e., before the owner showed it to the priest there was no tzara'at but it became leprous while in the hands of the priest, that they too become ritually impure. If one cut pieces from each of these types and made of them a single cloth, from where is it derived that it can become ritually impure? The verse states from the broader amplification: Or in anything made of hide.  The Talmud remarks: There is room to refute this parallel, rendering it impossible to derive the laws of ritual impurity imparted by a corpse from the laws of tzara'at. What is the comparison to tzara'at with regard to which the Torah is stringent, as even the warp and woof that have not been woven into a garment can become ritually impure from it,  which is not the case in impurity imparted by a corpse?"

R' Yonatan ben Yosef says:  It would have been sufficient for the verse to simply state: And it shall be washed and shall be pure. For what purpose does the verse state: “A second time”?  The Torah juxtaposes the second washing,  the immersion, with the first washing,  the laundering. Just as the first washing is performed with intent,  as it is written: “And the priest shall command that they wash the garment that has the leprous mark, and he shall quarantine it seven days more” (Leviticus 13:54), so too, the second washing,  the immersion in a ritual bath, must be performed with intent.

The Talmud asks: And say that when the verse excluded,  it excluded specifically a garment that is three by three fingerbreadths; however,  a garment that is three by three handbreadths can become ritually impure.  The Talmud replies: Two exclusions are written;  once it is stated: “A garment of wool or linen” (Leviticus 13:59), and it is also stated: “Whether it be a woolen garment, or a linen garment” (Leviticus 13:47). One verse comes to exclude cloth of three by three fingerbreadths, and one verse comes to exclude cloth of three by three handbreadths, to emphasize that a garment made of a material that is neither wool nor linen cannot become ritually impure at all.

The school of R' Yishmael taught: The verse states: “And shall let go the living bird into the open field” (Leviticus 14:7), which indicates that the bird is like a field: Just as a field is permitted, so too, this bird is also permitted.  The Talmud asks: Is that word “field” coming to teach this? That word is necessary for that which is taught in a baraita: The word “field” teaches that one may not stand in Jaffa and throw the bird that is set free to the sea,  or stand in Gevat and throw it to the desert, and that he may not stand outside the city and throw it inside the city. Rather, any manner in which he is standing in the city and throws it outside the wall to the field is valid. The word “field” teaches that one must set it free only to the field and nowhere else, not to teach that the bird is permitted."

How is this derived? The only meaning of the term “his tent” is his wife, as is stated after the giving of the Torah: “Go say to them, return again to your tents” (Deuteronomy 5:27). This statement rendered it permitted for the men to once again have sex with their wives after they had previously been prohibited to do so in anticipation of the giving of the Torah, as expressed in the verse: “Come not near a woman” (Exodus 19:15).

Therefore, the verse states: “His head, ” to teach that a nazirite who is a metzora must shave his head with a razor.

And the fact that this verse is referring to a finger from his right hand is derived from a metzora, as it is written: “And the priest shall dip his right finger” (Leviticus 14:16). This cannot be correct, as there is the verse that addresses the removal of a handful from a meal offering, in which only the priesthood is written, and yet we learned in a Mishnah (Menaḥot 6a): If one removed the handful with his left hand, the meal offering is disqualified.

And R' Yehuda HaNasi says with regard to the log of oil of a metzora that it is not the blood of the guilt offering that renders it permitted; rather, the placements of its oil “before YHWH” (Leviticus 14:16) render the remainder of the oil permitted to be eaten by the priests. And from the fact that the placements of its oil render the oil permitted,  by the same token the placements of its oil render it piggul,  i.e., if the oil was placed with the intent that the priests should consume its remainder on the following day, one who consumes the oil is liable for consuming piggul."

As Rabba bar bar Ḥana says that Reish Lakish says:  In any place in the Torah that it is stated that an action is performed with a finger, or that it is performed by priesthood,  the halakha is that the rite is performed only with the right hand. This is derived from the Torah’s statement with regard to the metzora: “And the priest shall dip his right finger” (Leviticus 14:16).

This returning and this coming have the same meaning, and one can therefore derive by verbal analogy that the halakha that applies if the tzara'at had spread at the conclusion of the first week applies if it had spread again by the end of the following week."

As the school of R' Yishmael taught a verbal analogy with regard to tzara'at of houses between the verse “and the priest shall return [veshav]” (Leviticus 14:39) and the verse “and the priest shall come [uva]” (Leviticus 14:44), from which it is derived that this is the halakha with regard to returning,  i.e., it is after seven days, and this is the same halakha with regard to coming,  that it is after seven days. Consequently, a less pronounced difference of one letter between the Hebrew words for “brothers” and “your brother” should certainly not prevent the teaching of a verbal analogy. The Talmud responds: This applies when nothing else was more similar, but where there is something similar we infer from that which is more similar.  In such situations, it is preferable to learn from the word that bears greater similarity."

From that verbal analogy it is derived that this is the halakha with regard to returning,  i.e., it is after seven days; and this is the same halakha with regard to coming,  i.e., it is also after seven days. Obviously, the less pronounced difference in grammatical forms between tziva and tzavoto should not prevent the teaching of a verbal analogy."

What did he want to say? With regard to one who enters a house afflicted with tzara'at,  if he enters the house backward,  then even if his entire body entered except for his nose,  which remained outside the house, he remains pure, as it is written: “He that enters into the house all the time that it is shut up shall be impure until evening” (Leviticus 14:46), teaching that the Torah prohibited,  i.e., conferred impurity, only with regard to the normal manner of entering into a house, i.e., face-first."

And it is taught in a baraita: Had the verse stated only the phrase “in the blood, ” one might have thought that these items must be dipped only in the blood and should not be dipped in the water at all. Therefore, the verse also states: “In the running water. ” If the verse had stated only the phrase “in the running water, ” one might have thought they should be dipped only in the water and not be dipped in the blood at all. Therefore, the verse also states: “In the blood. ” How can these texts be reconciled? One must bring little enough water so that the blood of the bird will still be recognizable within it. And how much water is this? It is a quarter-log."

As even though the shade of an egg membrane is two stages below that of a se’et, God states: “And for a se’et and for a sappaḥat” (Leviticus 14:56), which indicates that a sappaḥat is secondary to a se’et and can combine with it even though a sappaḥat is of a much lower degree of brightness than it.  R' Akiva holds that both of the additional shades not explicitly mentioned in the Torah are derived from the word: Sappaḥat, and so both of them can combine with a se’et. But the difficulty raised with regard to a mark the color of the lime plaster of the Sanctuary walls is indeed difficult. Rather, it is clear that the Mishnah is not in accordance with the opinion of R' Akiva. "
