However, if one comes to recite verses of Kingship, remembrance, and shofar with a theme of the punishment of non-Jews, one may recite them. The Talmud offers examples of these verses: With regard to the verses of Kingship, for example: “YHWH reigns, let the peoples tremble” (Psalms 99:1), and, for example: “YHWH is King for ever and ever; the nations are perished out of His land” (Psalms 10:16). With regard to remembrance, for example: “Remember, O Lord, against the children of Edom the day of Jerusalem, who said: Raze it, raze it, to its very foundation” (Psalms 137:7). With regard to the verses of shofar, for example: “And YHWH God will sound the shofar, and will go with whirlwinds of the south” (Zechariah 9:14), and it is written: “YHWH of hosts will defend them” (Zechariah 9:15), i.e., God will defend the Jewish people against their enemies."

The verse compares the corners to hollow basins. Here too,  doesn’t God state that the altar must be made of “unhewn stones”?  If so, how could the corners be hollow? Rather,  it must be that he places something,  e.g., sticks and twigs, under the frame and pours the mixture for the corners over it, and when it has hardened, removes the sticks and twigs, leaving the corners somewhat hollow. Here too, he places something under the frame and later removes it. "

Isn’t it taught in a baraita: One who vows not to benefit from tirosh is not allowed sweet foods,  e.g., sweet fruits, but is allowed wine.  Therefore, tirosh is not wine but sweet food. The Talmud rejects this: And is tirosh not wine? But isn’t it written: “Tirosh shall make the young women flourish [yenovev]” (Zechariah 9:17). The word yenovev comes from the word niv, speech. Consequently, tirosh is a food that tempts the heart and mouth of the drinker, even of virgins, who are modest and reticent. Since sweet foods do not have this effect, tirosh must be wine. The Talmud replies: This is not a proof, since we could explain it otherwise: Something that comes from tirosh,  such as wine, causes virgins to come forth;  tirosh itself means sweet grapes. Perhaps wine is called tirosh only by extension because it is made from tirosh."

R' Yoḥanan said to Reish Lakish: It is not satisfactory to God, their Master, that you said this about them,  that the overwhelming majority of the world will be destroyed. Rather, even as many as one-3rd of the descendants of Noah,  one-3rd of the population of the world, will remain."

It means equivalent to its place,  i.e., Jerusalem will be raised to a height whose measure in parasangs corresponds to the measure of its area in square parasangs. The Talmud asks: And from where is it derived that the place of Jerusalem was an area of three square parasangs? Rabba said that a certain elder said to me: I saw the initial Jerusalem,  when it was still extant, and its area was three square parasangs. "

However, according to the ones who said these other two explanations, what is the meaning of the expression: “There shall no longer be a merchant”? R' Yirmeya said:  The word kena’ani is in fact a contraction of the phrase: There is no poor person here [ein kan ani].  In other words, there will no longer be poor people, and therefore the Jews themselves will be able to donate whatever is needed in the Temple (Maharsha)."
