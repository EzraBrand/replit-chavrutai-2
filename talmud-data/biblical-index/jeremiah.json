Children die because their fathers did not accept the morality, the Torah. <b>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: According to the one who said</b> that one’s children die <b>because of the sin of vows, it can also</b> be derived <b>from here: In vain have I smitten your children; on matters of vanity, </b> i.e., when one vows in vain and does not fulfill it. The Talmud asks: <b>After all, R' Yehuda HaNasi is R', and</b> it was taught in a <i>Tosefta</i> that <b>R' said</b> that one’s children die <b>because of the sin of vows. </b> How then could it be that R' Yehuda HaNasi said that it is due to the sin of dereliction in the study of Torah?
