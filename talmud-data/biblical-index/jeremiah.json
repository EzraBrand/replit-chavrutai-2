This verse is difficult; since it is a land through which no person has passed, how could anyone have settled there permanently? The statement that “no person has settled there” is redundant.

The Talmud asks: Granted,  according to the opinion of the one who said that children die due to the sin of mezuza,  it is based on the juxtaposition of the verses, as it is written: “And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house,  and upon your gates,” and it says thereafter: “That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children. ” However, according to the one who said that children die because of the sin of ritual fringes, what is the reason?  What is the connection between these matters? Rav Kahana said, and some say that it was Sheila Mari:  It is homiletically interpreted as is written: “Also in your corners is found the blood of the souls of the innocent poor” (Jeremiah 2:34). Due to one’s failure to affix ritual fringes to the corners of his garments, the innocent poor, young children, who have not had opportunity to sin, die. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: According to the one who said that children die because of the sin of mezuza, it is also derived from here, as it is written in the continuation of that verse: “You did not find them breaking in;  yet for all these things. ” We see that this punishment comes because they made entrances like a thief’s breach in the wall. They did not place mezuzot in their entrances."

But you have committed adultery with many lovers; and would you yet return to Me, said YHWH” (Jeremiah 3:1). Indeed, the Torah states: “Her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife after she has been made impure” (Deuteronomy 24:4). The relationship between the Jewish people and God is compared to that between a husband and wife. Just as it is prohibited for an adulterous wife to return to her husband, it should be prohibited for the Jewish people to return to God from their sins, yet repentance overrides this prohibition."

In this verse, the term gozi relates to the hair of the head. Abba Shaul says:  An embryo is formed from its navel, and it sends its roots forth.

If you say that a eulogy is delivered due to the honor of the living, why should the wicked not be eulogized, as perhaps they are survived by righteous people who are worthy of this honor? The Talmud answers: It is not satisfactory to the righteous when they are honored through the wicked,  and therefore they prefer that a eulogy not be delivered for their wicked relatives."

What is the meaning of that which is written: “House of David, so says YHWH: Execute justice in the morning, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor” (Jeremiah 21:12)? And is it so that a court may judge in the morning, and all the rest of the day a court may not judge?  Why does the verse specifically relate to judging in the morning? Rather,  the meaning is: If the matter is as clear to you as the morning, state the verdict; and if not, do not state it. R' Ḥiyya bar Abba says that R' Yonatan says this principle may be derived from here: “Say to wisdom: You are my sister” (Proverbs 7:4). If the matter is as clear to you as the fact that your sister is forbidden to you, state it, and if not, do not state it. "

As it was taught in a baraita: R' Eliezer says: The night consists of three watches, and over each and every watch, God sits and roars like a lion in pain over the destruction of the Temple. This imagery is derived from a reference in the Bible, as it is stated: “YHWH roars [yishag] from on high, from His holy dwelling He makes His voice heard. He roars mightily [shaog yishag] over His dwelling place,  He cries out like those who tread grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth” (Jeremiah 25:30).

And he would write the documents in his handwriting and others would sign. And the incident came before the rabbis and they deemed it valid. And why did they deem it valid? Isn’t there a need to fulfill this verse: “I took the deed of purchase” (Jeremiah 32:11), requiring that the document itself be transferred from the seller to the buyer, and this is not the case here, as the document attesting to the loan was in the possession of the creditor the entire time?"

This describes the writing of a bill of sale to serve as proof of ownership of the field, since he was unable to remain living there for three years to establish the presumption of ownership. As the prophet Jeremiah stood in the 10th year of King Zedekiah’s reign and warned people to write bills of sale for the eleventh year, when Eretz Yisrael would be overrun. Consequently, despite the fact that one purchasing a field there would be able to live on the land for two years, this would not be sufficient to establish the presumption of ownership, which is why he said that they should have bills of sale written."

The Talmud asks: Is that so,  that Torah study is beneficial only for the soul of the person who has studied? But didn’t R' Elazar say: If not for the Torah and its study, heaven and earth would not be sustained, as it is stated: “If not for My covenant by day and by night, I would not have set up the laws of heaven and earth” (Jeremiah 33:25). It is the Torah, the eternal covenant that is studied day and night, that justifies the continued existence of the world. The Talmud answers: This is indeed correct, but at the outset when a person does this mitzva, he does it for himself,  and only afterward does he have in mind the benefit that will be brought to the entire world."

Hananiah raised an a fortiori inference himself: If,  with regard to Elam, which came only to assist Babylonia, God said: “Behold, I will break the bow of Elam, ” all the more so are the Chaldeans,  i.e., the Babylonians, themselves,  destined to fall. Hananiah came to the lower market and said: “So speaks YHWH of hosts, the God of Israel, saying: I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon” (Jeremiah 28:2).
