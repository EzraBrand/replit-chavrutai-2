          "talmudFullText": "§ The Mishnah teaches that the High Priest exits and comes out the way that he entered,  i.e., he does not turn around, but walks backward with his face toward the Ark. The Talmud asks: From where are these matters derived; what is the source in the Torah for this halakha? R' Shmuel bar Naḥmani said that R' Yonatan said that the verse states: “And Solomon came to the high place that was at Gibeon, Jerusalem” (II Chronicles 1:13). Now, what does Gibeon have to do with Jerusalem?  Either he came to Gibeon or to Jerusalem; these are two different places."

King Solomon said to Hiram of Tyre: “Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of YHWH my God, to dedicate it to Him, and to burn before Him incense of sweet spices, and for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the Shabbatot, and on the New Moons, and on the Festivals of YHWH our God. This is an ordinance forever for Israel” (II Chronicles 2:3). Since the Temple was eventually destroyed, what did Solomon mean when he said that it is “an ordinance forever”? Rav Giddel says that Rav says: This is referring to the altar that remains built in Heaven even after the earthly Temple was destroyed, and the angel Michael, the great minister, stands and sacrifices an offering upon it.

The Talmud asks: But according to the one who says that their faces were turned one toward the other, isn’t it written: “And their faces were toward the House” (II Chronicles 3:13)? How does he explain the meaning of this verse? The Talmud answers: This is not difficult,  as their faces miraculously changed directions in reflection of the Jewish people’s relationship to God. Here,  when it states that the cherubs faced each other, it was when the Jewish people do the will of God. There,  the verse that describes that the cherubs faced the Sanctuary and not toward each other, was when the Jewish people do not do the will of God. "

The Talmud challenges: Let Rava resolve his dilemma from his own statement with regard to one who left the Temple with small steps, heel to toe, as such a person tarries intermittently between steps. The Talmud answers: There Rava is referring to one who did not tarry at all, walking continuously without interruption, albeit slowly.

What is the meaning of “the new courtyard”? R' Yoḥanan says:  This is referring to the place in which they innovated many matters and said that one who immersed that day may not enter the camp of the Levites,  which in Jerusalem includes the entire Temple Mount. This indicates that the prohibition is of rabbinic origin, and by Torah law it is permitted for him to enter."

Ḥizkiyya said: As the verse states: “And their father gave them great gifts, of silver, and of gold, and of precious things, with fortified cities in Judea” (II Chronicles 21:3).

And that which is taught in the first baraita, that in such a case he does not acquire the movable property, the reason for this ruling is that the tanna of that baraita holds that in order for movable property to be acquired together with land, we require that he acquire land similar to “fortified cities in Judea” (II Chronicles 21:3), which do not move around.  Slaves, even if their legal status is generally like that of land, do not fulfill this requirement."

God said: I was angry with Ahaz and I delivered him into the hand of the kings of Damascus. He then sacrificed offerings and burned incense to their gods, as it is stated: “He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus that smote him; and he said: Because the gods of the kings of Aram help them, I will sacrifice to them, and they will help me. But they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel” (II Chronicles 28:23). When God was angry with Israel and caused them to lose a war to prompt them to repent of their sins, their response was to worship idols."
