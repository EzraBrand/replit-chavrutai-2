          "talmudFullText": "§ The Talmud returns to the primary topic of this chapter, the book of Esther. The Talmud cites various aggadic interpretations of the verses of the Megilla. The opening verse of the Megilla states: “And it came to pass [vayhi] in the days of Ahasuerus” (Esther 1:1). R' Levi said, and some say that it was R' Yonatan who said: This matter is a tradition that we received from the members of the Great Assembly. Anywhere that the word vayhi is stated, it is an ominous term indicating nothing other than impending grief,  as if the word were a contraction of the words vai and hi, meaning woe and mourning."

Rav said:  The word vayhi may be understood as if it said vai and hi,  meaning woe and mourning. This is as it is written: “And there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for bondsmen and bondswomen,  and no man shall buy you” (Deuteronomy 28:68). The repetitive nature of the verse, indicating that no one will be willing to buy you for servitude, but they will purchase you in order to murder you, indicates a doubly horrific situation, which is symbolized by the dual term vayhi, meaning woe and mourning."

Rav Ḥisda said:  This verse should be understood as follows: At first he reigned over seven provinces; and then he reigned over twenty more; and finally he reigned over another hundred.  The Talmud asks: However, if that is so,  with regard to the similarly worded verse: “And the years of the life of Amram were seven and thirty and a hundred years” (Exodus 6:20), what would you expound from it?  The Talmud answers: It is different here,  in the book of Esther, as this part of the verse is entirely superfluous. Since it is already written: “From Hodu to Cush, ” why then do I need “Seven and twenty and a hundred provinces”?  Rather, learn from here that these words come for this exposition,  to teach that Ahasuerus did not begin to reign over all of them at the same time."

Why is Persia mentioned first at the beginning of the Megilla, while later in the Megilla, Media is mentioned first? Rava said in response: These two peoples, the Persians and the Medes, stipulated with each other,  saying: If the kings will come from us, the ministers will come from you; and if the kings will come from you, the ministers will come from us.  Therefore, in reference to kings, Media is mentioned first, whereas in connection with nobles and princes, Persia is given priority."

One who, according to his stature, was fit for the courtyard was brought to the courtyard; one who was fit for the garden was brought to the garden;  and one who was fit for the palace was brought to the palace.

He then sat them in the garden, but it did not hold them either, until he brought them into the palace and it held them.

And the other one said:  It is precisely this that indicates that he was a foolish king. The one who said that this proves that he was a clever king maintains that he acted well when he first brought close those more distant subjects by inviting them to the earlier celebration, as he could appease the residents of his own city whenever he wished. And the one who said that he was foolish maintains that he should have invited the residents of his city first, so that if those faraway subjects rebelled against him, these who lived close by would have stood with him.

And Shmuel said:  There is a precious stone in the seaports, and its name is dara,  and Ahasuerus placed it in the center of the feast, and it illuminated the festivities for them as the sun illuminates the world at midday.  He explains that the word soḥaret is derived from tzohar, a light. A scholar from the school of R' Yishmael taught a baraita: This means that he proclaimed a remission for all the merchants,  absolving them from paying their taxes, understanding that the word dar derives from deror, freedom, and soḥaret from soḥer, merchant."

The verse continues: “That they should do according to every man’s pleasure” (Esther 1:8). Rava commented on the literal meaning of the verse, which is referring to two men, a man and a man [ish va’ish], and said:  The man and man whom they should follow indicates that they should do according to the wishes of Mordecai and Haman.  The two of them served as butlers at the feast, and they were in charge of distributing the wine. Why is the verse interpreted in this way? Mordecai is called “man,” as it is written:  “There was a certain Jewish man [ish] in Shushan the castle, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair” (Esther 2:5).

Ahasuerus said to them: Judge her for me.  The rabbis said in their hearts: What should we do?  If we say to him: Kill her, tomorrow he will become sober and then come and demand her from us.  If we say to him: Let her be, she has scorned royalty,  and that cannot be tolerated. Consequently, they decided not to judge the matter, and they said to him as follows: From the day that the Temple was destroyed and we have been exiled from our land, counsel and insight have been removed from us, and we do not know how to judge capital cases,  as they are exceptionally difficult.

The verse states: “When Mordecai perceived all that was done,  Mordecai rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and bitter cry” (Esther 4:1). The Talmud asks: What did Mordecai say when he cried out? Rav said:  He said that Haman has risen above Ahasuerus,  for he saw that Haman had become even stronger than Ahasuerus himself, and that he controlled all affairs of the empire. And Shmuel said: The upper King has prevailed over the lower king,  saying this euphemistically and insinuating just the opposite. In other words, it would appear that Ahasuerus, the lower king, has prevailed over the higher King, God in Heaven, Who desires good for the Jewish people."

Go away from him so that you should not get burnt from his coals,  i.e., that you should not suffer harm as well. At that moment Mordecai wrapped himself in his prayer shawl and stood up to pray.

It is called a book,  indicating a comparison to the book of the Torah, i.e., to a Torah scroll, to teach us that if one sewed its parchment sheets together with flax threads the Megilla is unfit,  just as a Torah scroll sewn in this manner is unfit. And it is called a letter to teach us that if one stitched the Megilla sheets together with only three threads of sinew,  in the manner of a letter, the Megilla is fit for use, as it does not have to be completely stitched like a Torah scroll. Rav Naḥman said: This is true provided that the stitches are made in three parts. "

          "talmudFullText": "§ The Talmud returns to its interpretations of verses in the Megilla. The Megilla mentions that among those invited to the king’s feast were: “The army of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces” (Esther 1:3), and it is written near the conclusion of the Megilla: “In the book of chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia” (Esther 10:2). Why is Persia mentioned first at the beginning of the Megilla, while later in the Megilla, Media is mentioned first? Rava said in response: These two peoples, the Persians and the Medes, stipulated with each other,  saying: If the kings will come from us, the ministers will come from you; and if the kings will come from you, the ministers will come from us.  Therefore, in reference to kings, Media is mentioned first, whereas in connection with nobles and princes, Persia is given priority."

The Talmud comments: The verse indicates that Mordecai was accepted only “By the majority of his brethren, ” but not by all his brethren.  This teaches that some members of the Sanhedrin parted from him,  because he occupied himself with community needs, and was therefore compelled to neglect his Torah study. They felt that this was a mistake and that he should have remained active on the Sanhedrin."
