The Talmud poses a question: Where did that wind go? Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: It went to conquer the entire world under the wicked Nebuchadnezzar. And why was all of this necessary?  Why was it necessary that the entire world be subjected to his dominion? So that the nations of the world would not say: God delivered His children into the hands of a lowly nation.  Since it was already decreed that the kingdom of Israel would fall into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, God made him into a great conqueror, so that Israel would not be ashamed of being defeated by him. God said with regard to this: Who caused Me to be an attendant to worshippers of molten images,  forcing Me to wage their wars? It was the sins of Israel that led Me to do so."

The Talmud answers: This is not difficult,  as here,  when the verse states they each had six wings, it is referring to the time when the Temple is standing,  while there,  where four wings are described, it is referring to the time when the Temple is not standing,  for it is as if the number of the wings of the animals were diminished so that they now have only four."

Therefore, how can crowns be woven for Him? Rather, it can be done by saying a name for the crown, and then the crown goes and sits on God’s head of its own accord."

R' Elazar said:  This wheel is a certain angel who stands on the earth and its head reaches the divine creatures. It was taught in a baraita:  This angel is named Sandalfon, who is taller than his colleague by a distance of five hundred years, and he stands behind the Divine Chariot and weaves crowns for his Maker.  The Talmud asks: Is that so?  Can crowns be woven for God? But isn’t it written: “Blessed be YHWH’s glory from His place” (Ezekiel 3:12), which proves by inference that no one knows His place?  Therefore, how can crowns be woven for Him? Rather, it can be done by saying a name for the crown, and then the crown goes and sits on God’s head of its own accord."

In this praise, “Blessed be the glory of YHWH,” the word “Lord” appears as the 3rd Hebrew word, apparently uttered by the ministering angels."

This cannot be understood literally, as refraining from performing these transgressions is not sufficient to characterize an individual as righteous. “He did not eat upon the mountains” is an allusion to the fact that he did not eat due to the merit of his fathers;  rather, he relies on his own merit and righteousness. “Nor did he lift his eyes toward the idols of the house of Israel” is a reference to one who distances himself from anything similar to idol worship, to the extent that he did not walk with upright stature,  typical of a haughty person, as haughtiness is typical of idolaters."

R' Elazar ben Yehuda, said: Due to the sin of failure to separate ḥalla from the dough, no blessing takes effect on the grain gathered in the storehouse and a curse spreads to the prices of crops, which increase, and they plant seeds and others eat their yield, as it is stated: “I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror [behala] over you, even consumption and fever, that shall make the eyes to fail and the soul to languish; and you shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it” (Leviticus 26:16).

And R' Ḥelbo said that Rav Huna said:  With regard to one who enters a synagogue to pray, he is permitted to make it into a shortcut for himself by leaving through a different exit, and it is fitting to do so, as it is stated: “And when the people of the land shall come before YHWH in the appointed seasons, he that enters by way of the north gate to bow down shall go forth by the way of the south gate” (Ezekiel 46:9). This indicates that it is a show of respect not to leave through the same entrance through which one came in; it is better to leave through the other side."

The rabbis asked R' Yehuda HaNasi: From where is this halakha derived? R' Yehuda HaNasi said to them: Doesn’t the verse state: “And he said to me: This is the place where the priests shall cook the guilt offering and the sin offering, where they shall bake the meal offering; that they do not bring them out to the outer courtyard,  to sanctify the people” (Ezekiel 46:20)? Cooking the meat of the guilt offering and the sin offering requires the use of a vessel, and the verse indicates that this must be performed inside the Temple courtyard, as the meat may not be brought to the outer courtyard."

The verse states: “For the water had swollen into saḥu waters” (Ezekiel 47:5). What does “saḥu waters” mean? Water that can be traversed only with a boat [shiyuta], as sailing [shayta] is sometimes called swimming [sayḥa]. I might have thought Ezekiel could pass across in a small boat [burni].  Therefore, the verse states: “No galley with oars shall go” (Isaiah 33:21). I might have thought he could pass through in a large boat.  Therefore, the verse states: “Neither shall a fishing boat [tzi adir] be able to cross it” (Isaiah 33:21). The Talmud asks: From where can it be inferred that the words tzi adir mean fishing boat? The Talmud explains: This is how Rav Yosef translated this verse: A fishing boat [sfinat tzayyadin] will not travel on it and a large ship will not cross it. "

It shall bring forth new fruit every month, because its waters issue out of the Sanctuary, and its fruit shall be for food, and its leaf for healing [litrufa]” (Ezekiel 47:12).
