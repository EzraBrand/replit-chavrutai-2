          "talmudFullText": "The Talmud asks: And was there fire that descended from the heavens in the Second Temple? Didn’t Rav Shmuel bar Inya say: What is the meaning of that which is written with regard to the Second Temple: “Go up to the hills and get wood and build the house; and I will look on it favorably and I will be glorified [ve’ekkaved],  said YHWH” (Haggai 1:8)? Even though it is written ve’ekkaved, we read it ve’ikkavda,  with an added letter heh. The Talmud explains: What is different that the word is missing the letter heh? This represents five,  the numerological value of heh, phenomena that constituted the difference between the First Temple and the Second Temple,  in that they were not in the Second Temple. And these are: The Ark of the Covenant, and the Ark cover upon it, and the cherubs that were on the Ark cover; fire; and the Shekhina; and the Holy Spirit; and the Urim VeTummim.  Apparently, there was no fire from heaven in the Second Temple. The rabbis say in response: Yes, there was fire from heaven in the Second Temple; however, it did not assist in burning the offerings but was merely visible above the wood."

However,  according to Rav, what is different here,  concerning the impurity of a creeping animal, such that the priests erred, and what is different there,  with regard to impurity imparted by a corpse, such that they did not err?

Granted,  according to the opinion of Rav that the priests erred, that is the reason that it is written:  “That which they offer there is impure, ” as the priests’ lack of familiarity with the halakhot of impurity increase the likelihood that all of their Temple service is ritually impure. However,  according to Shmuel, why does the verse say that their offerings are ritually impure? "
