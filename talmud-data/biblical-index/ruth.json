          "talmudFullText": "And further, with regard to R' Elazar’s statement in the baraita that the generation of the judging of the Judges was one of vanity, R' Yoḥanan says: What is the meaning of that which is written: “And it happened in the days of the judging of the Judges” (Ruth 1:1)? This indicates a generation that judged its judges.  If a judge would say to the defendant standing before him: Remove the splinter from between your eyes,  meaning rid yourself of some minor infraction, the defendant would say to him: Remove the beam from between your eyes,  meaning you have committed far more severe sins. If the judge would say to him: “Your silver is become dross” (Isaiah 1:22), meaning your coins are counterfeit, the defendant would say to him: “Your wine is mixed with water” (Isaiah 1:22), meaning you yourself dilute your wine with water and sell it. Since nobody behaved in proper manner, the judges were unable to judge."

It is written: “Mahlon and Chilion” (Ruth 1:2), and it is written elsewhere: “Joash and Saraph,  who had dominion in Moab” (I Chronicles 4:22). Apparently, both names refer to the same individuals who married Moabite wives. Rav and Shmuel disagreed with regard to their true names. One says: Their given names were Mahlon and Chilion, and why were they called by the names Saraph and Joash?  One was called Joash [yoash] because they despaired [nitya’ashu] of the redemption of Eretz Yisrael, as they established themselves in Moab and lived there for many years. The other was called Saraph, because they were liable to receive the punishment of burning [sereifa] for their sins against God,  because they left their community."

The Talmud asks: From where is this inferred?  The Talmud supplies a mnemonic. Rabba bar Rav Sheila said that the latter part of the verse states:  “So shall no inheritance transfer from one tribe to another tribe; for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave each one [ish] to its own inheritance,” alluding to the transfer by means of the husband, as the word “ish” means husband, in the context of: “Elimelech the husband [ish] of Naomi” (Ruth 1:3). The Talmud asks: But the word “ish” is written in both of the verses. Therefore, both verses should be interpreted with regard to the transfer of the inheritance by means of the husband."

Rav and Shmuel engaged in a dispute concerning this matter. One of them said: Her name was Harafa, and why is she called by the name Orpah?  It is because everyone came at her from behind [orfin] her,  i.e., sodomized her. And one of them said: Her name was Orpah, and why is she called by the name Harafa?  It is because everyone threshed her like groats [harifot],  i.e., had sex with her, and so it says that this word means groats: “And the woman took and spread the covering over the well’s mouth, and strewed groats [harifot] thereon” (II Samuel 17:19). And if you wish,  you can say from here: “Though you should crush a fool in a mortar with a pestle among groats [harifot],  yet will not his foolishness depart from him” (Proverbs 27:22)."

Rav Yehuda said that Shmuel said:  It is the place where he grips the vessel in order to pass [tzovet] it, a kind of indentation used for grasping the vessel. And similarly it states: “And he pinched [vayitzbat] some parched corn for her” (Ruth 2:14), which means that he gave her a little of the corn. Therefore, the term is referring to a place on the vessel used to grasp it. R' Asi said that R' Yoḥanan said:  It is the place that fastidious people use for dipping.  A small receptacle for spices and the like would be attached to the sides of vessels for dipping one’s food."
