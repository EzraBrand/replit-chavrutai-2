# Number Parsing

## Architecture

Number-word-to-digit conversion happens in multiple layers depending on text type.

### Layer 1: Algorithmic Cardinal Parser — `shared/number-parser.ts`

Converts contiguous English number-word sequences to digits:
- `parseNumbers(text)` — main entry point, replaces all number-word sequences in text
- `tryParseCardinal(raw)` — parses a single matched sequence into an integer
- `formatCardinal(n)` — formats with commas for numbers >= 1,000

Handles: units, teens, tens, hundreds, thousands, millions, billions, "a hundred", biblical inversions ("five and twenty").

Does NOT handle: ordinals (first, fifth, tenth), fractions (half, quarter, one-third).

Standalone "one" and "two" are excluded (too ambiguous in prose).

### Layer 2: Algorithmic Ordinal Converter — `server/lib/bible-text-processing.ts`

The `convertOrdinals()` function (Bible-only, server-side) converts ordinal words to digit+suffix form BEFORE `parseNumbers()` runs. This prevents `parseNumbers` from converting the cardinal part (e.g., "twenty" → "20") and leaving the ordinal suffix orphaned (e.g., "20-fifth").

Coverage:
- Compound ordinals: "twenty-first" → "21st", "thirty-fifth" → "35th" (all tens 20-90 + all unit ordinals)
- Standalone ordinals 11-30: "eleventh" → "11th" through "nineteenth" → "19th", "twentieth" → "20th", "thirtieth" → "30th" (NOTE: "tenth" excluded — ambiguous with fraction 1/10th, especially due to עשרון)
- Teens: "eleventh" → "11th" through "nineteenth" → "19th"

Order of operations in `processBibleEnglish()`: ordinals → then cardinals.

### Layer 3: Static Term Replacements — `shared/data/term-replacements.json`

Runs via `replaceTerms()`. Handles special cases:
- `ordinals_fractional`: "one-third" → "1/3rd", "two-fifths" → "2/5ths"
- `time_ordinals`: "the fifth day" → "the 5th day", "the tenth month" → "the 10th month"
- `ordinals_basic`: "third" → "3rd", "fourth" → "4th", "tenth" → "10th"
- `ordinals_compound`: "twenty-first" → "21st", "thirty-fifth" → "35th"

## Where Each Text Type Gets Processed

### Talmud / Mishnah / Yerushalmi
- `shared/text-processing.ts` → `replaceTerms()` (term replacements + ordinals) → `parseNumbers()` (cardinals)
- Both layers apply in sequence

### Bible
- Server-side: `server/lib/bible-text-processing.ts` → `processBibleEnglish()`:
  1. Comma stripping after magnitude words ("thousand, five hundred" → "thousand five hundred")
  2. `convertOrdinals()` — compound/standalone ordinals to digits
  3. `parseNumbers()` — cardinal numbers to digits
- Client-side: `client/src/lib/text-processing.ts` → `processBibleEnglishText()` → `replaceTerms()`
  - Term replacements also run on Bible text on the frontend

## Common Issues

### Numbers split across commas
Source text like "forty six thousand, five hundred" gets split into two numbers.
Fix: The comma-stripping regex in `processBibleEnglish()` handles this:
```js
.replace(/\b(thousand|million|billion),\s+/gi, '$1 ')
```

### Compound ordinals broken by cardinal parser
"twenty-fifth" becomes "20-5th" because `parseNumbers` converts "twenty" to "20" first.
Fix: `convertOrdinals()` runs BEFORE `parseNumbers()` and converts compound ordinals to digit form first.

### Ordinals converted to fractions
Rules in `ordinals_fractional` (term-replacements.json) can match ordinal contexts.
Example: `"a fifth": "1/5th"` converted Bible's "a fifth day" to "1/5th day".
Fix: Remove overly broad fractional rules. Keep specific forms like "one-fifth" or "one fifth".

### False matches in prose
The algorithmic parser excludes standalone "one" and "two" via `STANDALONE_EXCLUSIONS` in `number-parser.ts`. Add more words there if needed.

## Adding a New Rule

### For Bible ordinals:
Update `convertOrdinals()` in `server/lib/bible-text-processing.ts`:
- New compound ordinal tens → add to `TENS_MAP`
- New standalone ordinal → add to `STANDALONE_ORDINAL_MAP`

### For Talmud/Mishnah ordinals or fractions:
Add to the appropriate section in `shared/data/term-replacements.json`:
- `ordinals_fractional` for fractions (one-third, two-fifths)
- `time_ordinals` for time-context ordinals (the fifth day → the 5th day)
- `ordinals_basic` for standalone ordinals (third → 3rd)

### For cardinal number issues:
Fix in `shared/number-parser.ts`:
- Missing word → add to `UNIT_MAP` or `MAGNITUDE_MAP`
- False positive → add to `STANDALONE_EXCLUSIONS`
- Connector issue → update `CONNECTOR` regex

## Key Principle

Term replacement rules must not be so broad they match ordinal/prose contexts. The algorithmic converter is preferred because it handles all compound ordinals systematically. For Bible text, ordinals MUST be converted before cardinals to prevent partial conversion.

## Testing

For simple term-replacement additions (adding entries to `term-replacements.json`), testing is usually unnecessary — just validate the JSON is well-formed:
```bash
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('shared/data/term-replacements.json')); print('Valid JSON')"
```
Then restart the app. The change will take effect on the rendered page.

Do NOT try to test via `curl` against API endpoints. There is no dedicated `/api/talmud/text` or similar JSON API that returns processed English text. Talmud/Mishnah/Yerushalmi English text processing (`replaceTerms`, `parseNumbers`) happens **client-side** in the browser, not on the server. The server fetches raw text from Sefaria and passes it through; the shared processing functions run in the frontend bundle.

For Bible text, server-side processing does occur in `processBibleEnglish()`, but the API endpoint returns full HTML pages, not JSON — so curl-based testing is not straightforward either.

If deeper verification is needed (e.g., for algorithmic parser changes or debugging), the best approach is:
1. Check the rendered page in the browser at the relevant tractate/chapter
2. Or write a quick inline test in the code_execution sandbox by importing the processing function
